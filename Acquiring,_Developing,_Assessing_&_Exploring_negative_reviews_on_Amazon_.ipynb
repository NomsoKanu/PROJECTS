Our XT2 is a little old and our Arlos are acting stupid. Saw this come out and had to give it a shot. It was time to upgrade. Plus, the specs of the possibility of TWO YEAR BATTERY LIFE is mindblowing. It's probably a lot less, but my Arlos would last a week with $10 CR123 batteries, so that had to go. Anything had to be better than those dinosaurs. Set up was fairly easy. There is no real printed instruction manual, but those are rare today. Scanned the QR code and my smartphone popped me to their website with tons of tips, info, and even setup videos. The entire setup process is QR from the new Sync Module 2 to the camera itself. So don't make the mistake of slapping the batteries in and closing the camera unit like I did before I scanned the QR code. Whoops. Took less than 15 minutes to setup and sync. Signed up for a new Blink account so the old one won't get confused - plus there's several weeks of free cloud storage right now. Boom. Set it up in a tree ACROSS from my house this time. When I put it over my door, my old cameras would flag every car or pedestrian close and far. All I want to see is the jerk stealing my UPS packages, so I flipped the perspective. The HD is super clean and clear, and the camera is at least 30 feet from the sync module with no problems connecting. Big plus there. And, there's a pretty powerful little speaker in this unit! I was really surprised at the volume this thing can push for such a small speaker. Now, when this alerts me to funny business, maybe I'll be able to yell at the perps. Probably not, because they'll be long gone by the time I see the notification. Still, this feature could be useful in warning your kids from doing something silly when you're not home. The live view was disappointing, since you have to keep clicking the app to continue the live view for longer than 10-ish seconds. So you can't use this as a spying device or a baby monitor. Bummer. Also, the default recording time was like 5 seconds, probably to maximize battery life. You can't catch much in 5 seconds. I adjusted mine in the settings to about 20 seconds. I'll sacrifice battery life to catch a bad actor. Plus, there's a battery pack you can attach to this unit to increase battery life. I'll update in the future to let you know how the battery goes. Overall, I'm impressed with the new Blink outdoor. It's gonna rain here in Florida soon, so I'll let you know how that goes as well as night shots when available.\"}\n",

Can arm/disarm camera to save on battery life, so if you're working in the yard, bringing in groceries etc... you're not constantly receiving notifications and using the battery life. 4. Your videos can be stored in the Cloud (for a nominal fee) or you can insert a USB into the sync module for local storage. If someone is brazen enough to steal the whole camera, you still have access to the video. 5. You can adjust the sensitivity level, so after you install the camera, you can reduce the level if you're getting too many notifications from trees, animals etc..setting off the alarm. 6. It is easy to adjust the camera (after you've installed it) if you want to change the angle for a better view. Cons: Connectivity (update) This issue has resolved itself. For the last 4 days, I have had no issues receiving notifications or viewing videos. If you experience first day hiccups, hang in there. 2. The only way to share access to your live videos is by giving your username & password to a person. The individual then has access to change your email address, password, and delete videos. Technically, they can lock you out of your own security system. Good luck with that if you have teenagers. While you want them to see what's going on outside if they're home alone, you don't want them deleting videos of friends who might visit the house when you're not home. Deal breaker. 3. This one is not a deal breaker. The camera is small, so if you're looking to deter criminals who are opportunist, they might not even notice the camera is there. Sometimes just the visual presence of a camera will deter individuals. I cannot speak to the longevity of the  battery life, which was one of the selling points for me. I'll update later if I encounter other issues.\"}\n",

The cameras take about 10 seconds to activate whereas our Wyze cameras take about 3 seconds. The fact that it will not interact and display feeds into the Ring app of our brand new Amazon Ring  alarm system (Ring alarm is awesome!) is my other very major gripe.

It has been totally re-engineered. Take it from someone who owns all the different cameras Blink had to offer since day one and had to get on a waiting list to get the  very first one. So, I should know what iam talking about. This new camera no longer has the push down and pull system to open the back to install batteries. It has a large screw that you simply unscrew with a included tool to open the back of the camera which is really nice. Once you open the back and install the included batteries scan the small QR code inside the camera threw the blink app it will scan to find the camera once that is done it will automatically do a firmware update. After that you are ready to install your new blink camera. Also noticed the sound is much louder and more clear then the other cameras. This is good if two people are talking in a low voice you can hear what they are saying. Has brighter clearer night vision. Nice clear voice communication with two way talk. Alot stronger wifi signal to sink module and from sink module to camera. Sharp, clear, bright, and colorful HD vision during the day. I noticed before I wrote this review that some people only gave this camera 2 or 3 stars. Like the guy who is complaining about software issues. Well if you follow the directions you would not have that problem. Let the camera finish its firmware update. Duh ! Also, if you have been a Blink customer for a while and want to add this camera to your current system. You do not have to pay for cloud storage you are grandfathered in. After you add this camera to your existing system it will actually tell you this ! The front of the camera has a all new face with a very smooth and shinny surface iam sure to help combat the weather and give it a more high tec look. Their is no longer a switch inside the camera to turn on or off the blue recording light located on the front of the camera. It's is all done threw the app which is really nice as well. They really did a good job in re-engineering this camera and listened to customer complaints about their past cameras and went threw and fixed every issue. I would definitely buy this camera again !  UPDATE : 09-25-20 After using this camera for a couple of days. And as other reviewers have noted that this camera only has a 25 foot motion trigger ! Anything further than 25 feet it will NOT record when motion is present. So if you need a camera get the Blink XT2 for the further range. This camera will only be good for specific areas like door or window that are within the 20 to 25 foot range from the camera.\"}\n",

Setup was a breeze and the image quality is great - especially when set to “best.” I really appreciate the custom activity zones that you can set, as well as the ability the turn off the led light. In terms of improvement, the included mount is pretty basic. For better or worse the mount snaps into the back of the camera module. This makes installing it relatively easy, but also means anyone could detach it with a firm pull. I’ve noticed that there are upgraded mounts that you buy, but haven’t had a chance to fully check those out yet. Lastly, I noticed another reviewer mentioned subscription pricing, but it’s a bit misleading. Yes, there is cloud storage that you can pay for, but there are multiple levels, including a free plan, as well as a basic plan for $3/month. Also, the paid plans don’t start until 2021. More importantly, What this camera has, that the XT2 doesn’t, is local storage. If you’re big on privacy, and don't want to store videos on the cloud, you can attach a USB drive to the blink module and save your videos there (see photo which shows the usb drive). There’s no fee for saving your videos locally - you can still get alerts and watch your video feed live for free.\"}\n",

They are extremely easy to set up and position. Only took about 2 hours start to finish. The bad. They turn on and capture video so late you literally miss all the action, which makes them literally useless. Just had another delivery, garage one triggered, saw the delivery persons boot exiting the frame, the front door one cought their lower back half, and it entirely missed them walking back through my driveway. Someone could casually stroll up my driveway, to my door, and steal my packages without a single face shot...Good idea in principle, horrible execution. Not happy with the purchase. Update: 2 more cameras were added to my system, they were added in a position to only catch movement in a 100% sideways motion view. They still trigger way to late in the initial settings to catch anything meaningful. My only remedy to catch action is to turn the motion clip up to 20-30 seconds on each camera and record even when motion stops, this is the only reliable way to catch people's faces and descriptive information, typically as they are coming back into the field of view and the camera is already turned on. I am sure this will annihilate the battery life on these cameras. I will update how long the batteries last, already getting many warnings of high usage.\"}\n",

The one advantage that blink has over wyze is that it can be used for alexa routines which turn things off if no motion is detected for a certain amount of time. If they ever add continuous recording when wired, or key support, they could fill a bigger niche, but the wyze v3 is currently better in every way, unless you can't run wires. The biggest reason i still havent sold these is that all cameras occasionally disconnect from WiFi and stop sending notifications, and having 2 different systems helps mitigate this risk. *Update I'm going ahead with 4 star at this point. After moving the cameras down off the soffits to around 10' high on the walls, they do meet the 25' range specified in the FAQs page. This ad the customer support received earns a slightly grudging 4 star. Just be aware of the limitations. I've added a couple screenshots with red lines added to illustrate where they pick me up in a meandering walk to the entrances. *Update bumped to 3-star, as it's more a description ommission than a product issue* I was contacted by customer support after writing my original review and doing a bit of research myself. Apparently the motion detection only has about a 25 ft range, so if you're like me and want to overlook a large area, these are not for you unless you get several cameras and mount them low. I wish this had been mentioned in the product details. It should be noted that the reason the motion detection range is so short compared with wyze, is that it uses an infrared sensor for primary motion detection. This is probably more reliable for outdoor and low light, but again, would have been nice to see on the product details. So, I'll be moving the cameras down from our 18' soffits and adding more cameras in the future. If they work significantly better lower, I'll bump the rating accordingly. Hopefully at some point in the near future blink adds continuous recording with event clips for those of us willing to hardwire power, and with local storage provided by the new sync mod 2. This would make the motion detection range much less of an issue. *Original 2-star review* Motion detection leaves a lot to be desired vs wyze. I've had this up for 2 days and get plenty of alerts for shadows and bugs, but when my wife pulls into the driveway, opens the gate, and walks 30 feet to the door before it picks up motion?? Also, it picks up my dogs every time they use the dog door, despite the zone being set to inactive. Back camera allowed me to walk around the backyard, then up 10 steps directly in front of the camera before picking motion up as I opened the screen door. The attached photo is at max resolution and was the start of the motion clip. At least with wyze I get constant recording to local storage, so I can review the preceding events when I get an alert like this. Maybe the motion detection works better if closer up and not covering a large area, but this is awful.\"}\n",

I almost bought Nest (which is about 4 times the cost and the no go for me was drilling a hole through my wall to run the wire into my house. 3) That said, since these cameras are set up on an outside bracket, and the camera itself pushes on to the bracket they don\\'t seem like the most secure camera. I live in the city. Anything that is not locked down could easily be stolen...especially if they are \"just above six foot level.\" I found a second party bracket that should make these camera attachments be more secure. Will report if they work. 4) For people losing their minds about cloud storage not being free starting in 2021 that is false. The system comes with a sync 2 module which will allow you to store your data in your home with a USB attached storage drive. I\\'m going to start with a 1 tb drive and see how much data is taken up with my 3 outdoor cameras and my one indoor camera. Update: the 1 Tb drive isn\\'t compatible with the system and it will only format a 64 gig drive or smaller. It\\'s ok. I needed a new thing drive. Will try another with smaller storage. It must be MS-DOS (FAT), ExFAT, or FAT32 supported. 5) These do have the talk feature, so if you get an alert you can always talk to the person outside \"place the package between my front and screen doors\" for example. 6) I\\'m still learning all the settings, but,  I think you can keep the system armed and turn off one camera (say in the house) when you are home. Finally, for the upfront cost and even with the purchase of additional brackets and drives, this is still a considerably more economical version than some outside security systems. I don\\'t necessary need all the bells and whistles just a simple security system.'}\n",

We will be trying to hide  in near a trumpet vine - with that we will need to make sure the vine doesn\\'t grow and cover the camera... that might fall or walk off.

Oliver', 'rating': '1.0', 'helpfulness_rating': '78', 'review': \"I have been waiting for a very long time to get a wireless security camera which I could stick on my house, connect to my web, Alexa, without wires and not have to plug into house power. I had high hopes for this camera. It is such a great idea. However, this camera did not do anything I expected it would do. 1. The night vision was so so. The daytime recordings weren't much better. You can’t really see a persons face, because the camera angle is so wide everything is so small in the frame. The picture quality isn't all that great, especially at night, so it is hard to see any quality of the image good enough to capture a distinguishable image of the person. The 16mm angle or whatever it is, is too big to capture a good image of a person who isn’t right up in the camera. 2. The camera and the settings are too buggy. The settings I would set the camera at weren't what got recorded. For example, I set it to 60 seconds of recording. It would only record 20 seconds at a time. Then it would do another 20 second recording and another until the movement in the camera was over. The problems with this type of recording is that they programmed in, at least a 10 second delay between recordings. So it misses a lot of the activity. I installed my camera at the front of my house looking out into the street. It had my driveway, the street in front of my house, to the left and to the right of my home in the view of the camera. Hardly ever did it actually catch any of the activity out in the street. (I did set the recording parameters to catch a very wide swath of the camera view.) Maybe once in awhile it would catch a car driving by but that was rare. So most of the time, all I got was the tail end of any movement that was up close to my home. And when I say up close, I mean like the last foot/edge of the screen. In other words,  as they were closest to my house, both coming and going and only recorded the top of their head. So when they were facing the camera, no face, just the top of their head. Hardly in between where all the actual activity happened and where you could actually see who it was. It would also, but less so, just catch the person far away as they arrived. Examples like - never did it catch any delivery truck or driver, except at the very beginning as they pulled up or the first second of leaving. So in other words, it never recorded or captured a good shot of anyone's face. I got a lot of dead space, dead air. A lot of before any major activity or after the activity was over. Not much in between, the actual activity/movement. I called customer service a couple of times, although they were nice and tried to be helpful, they couldn’t fix any of these problems. So I think for this to be a good product they need to do the following: 1. Make the recordings actually record any and all of the activity not just 20 second clips AND there should NOT be any delay between recordings. It should just be a continuous until any and all activity is over. 2. The camera should have a better image quality. So you can take a capture of the persons face, zoom in and see who they are. 3. The delay between motion, recording it AND notifying me that there is motion is too long. I hope they fix it. But for now I had to return it and wouldn’t recommend this camera.\"}\n",

I assumed this camera would have local storage, which it does, but in the worst way imaginable. You need a paid cloud subscription so that this will upload your recordings to the internet and then at the end of the day, those recordings get saved to your local USB drive attached to the hub. Having local storage on a USB drive does nothing on its own. The camera could be like virtually any other camera out there and record directly to that but does it? Nope! Can anyone say STUPID?! This thing was purposefully engineered in the most backwards, greediest way possible. I was prepared to deal with it because it’s honestly one of the best cameras around. But now I’m questioning that. TWO times has someone (someone I know, thankfully) come onto my property and the camera hasn’t once caught them on camera. Oh but my neighbor leaving his driveway and his tire gets caught in frame? That gets recorded....  neighborhood cats running under the gate also gets recorded. But a human body standing in place, unlocking the lock on my gate, opening the gate, walking through the opening, closing the gate, and locking the gate gets NO notification to me. Also, once I saw this person walking out of frame. This is what was recorded. Not the person unlocking and opening the gate. All I got for a recording was their shoulder as they walked out of frame and then a few more seconds of nothing. And yes, I have that beta option selected to begin recording and alert me to notifications the second it picks up motion. This thing is garbage. I’m so mad that I’m beyond my point of being able to return this. Go with another camera for your sanity and serenity. This thing is garbage and Amazon is milking money out of it for no valid reason. The night vision is cool. The picture quality is cool. But when you have to pay a subscription fee for life to use it properly and it doesn’t detect what you want it to...is it really worth it?

It has a nice dynamic range. The POV is pretty good. Its plenty wide and a little fisheye. For the most part pretty clear. 👍 The audio is fairly decent but you get a lot of humming and hissing. The microphone where you can talk to someone is fairly decent. You're talking about close distance about average distance of someone at your front door. The setup is pretty easy just install the app and follow the instructions. Let it update the firmware. One tip when you get to the cameras leave the back off because you will have to scan the QR code. So why not 5 stars since this is pretty cool? The battery life is not 2 years. I don't know why they say that. I'll update what I got but it all depends on use. The back where you put the batteries screws on and off with a wonky tool they give you. It would be fine if it was a twist lock not an actual screw. The price is kinda steep. I needed 4 cameras. 4 sides to a house or building right? They don't have a 4 camera bundle. 3 or jump to 5. I purchased another single camera because it was only $10 more with a sync module than a add on camera. Not much security for the camera itself. It just pops off. Anyone can steal it. The camera mount has a limited angle. Its basically made for a straight flat install. I bought separate swivel mounts so I can mount it to the underside of my roof on the side of my house and place the camera looking down the side of my house. They should upgrade the mount. You can always mount the camera higher to avoid theft but sometimes that's limited. Overall this is a pretty good simple to set up and use camera system. The night vision and motion detection are pretty good. Im happy with the all new Blink so far. They should have kept the free cloud storage but i prefer the separate thumbdrive storage. Less chances of hacking being all over the interweb. Using a thumbdrive is not a problem. Maybe they should include one. There's a slight delay in the live shot. Hear something and you wanna click live view you wait a few seconds and by that time the action is gone. They need to make that faster. As for getting notifications instantly when the motion detection is triggered its not bad but there's a delay there too. And it does not recognize or connect to my 5G only to 2.4G on my wifi. 😐 Like I said its pretty good but could use some improvements and am sure they will continue to do so but for now for what I'm using it for as simple security and being able to monitor my house and yes I can be away and monitor my house from afar yeah definitely worth getting. 👍 UPDATE: Its been a month and a half and the batteries are still good. I do notice not as much hissing and screeching noise. Don't know if that means battery life is going down and the mic is less powered or what but everything still works pretty good. Picked up several of the mini cams as well on sale. Great for inside and the garage. Had one on the patio but it got a little moisture slime. Didn't affect the camera though but I did move it in. Had one hick up. It said view failed or something like that once and I couldn't get a live view. I just took a photo and it seemed to clear that up. I see a lot of people showing that in the reviews so thought that would help. I also see a lot of reviews posting pics of bad night vision. You need to reposition your camera. You either have something below it or above it too close to the lens. For example if you have it mounted under an awning and you get a dark picture or you get a foggy looking halo ring you need to bring the camera out further so there is not much covering the top or bottom. The sides are also affected but not as much. Move it around remember camera position is key for good night vision. Even though it's made for the outdoors you don't want it in direct sunlight where the unit will go passed the 110deg limit. That will kill battery performance and camera capabilities. Hope that helps some of you with those issues. I will update again on battery life. So far its near Thanksgiving and batteries are good. I arm it at night 100% of the time. During the day a little less. I've captured several delivery personnel a raccoon a couple of cats sun glare off my pool some dust looking particles that look like spirits flying away 😄 and of course myself when I forget to disarm 😃 and the battery indicator says OK. They really need a percentage indicator on that. I live view several times a day but only for a few seconds if there's nothing going on. The cloud thing is not a big deal at all. Get a thumbdrive and you're good to go. All your clips are saved on that instead of the cloud. I love the easy sharing too. I will text my friends with a short clip I can upload straight to my YouTube channel. Its pretty cool. One thing I would like to see is a shorter break between clips. You can miss a lot in 10 seconds. And a longer recording capability than 30sec especially with motion. I know that can eat battery life but they can improve there as well.🖖😉👍 UPDATE 2: I'm getting more failed to connect to cloud indications and I'm not using the cloud I'm using a thumbdrive. I'm also getting more false recordings. Nothing is happening and it will record a clip. Also a live view will pop up in the recorded clip segment. 🤔 Its starting to be a little fidgety but not to the point it upsets me. UPDATE 3: One of the cameras needed a reset. Pop the batteries out then pop em back in. 🤔 It said failed view or not available something like that. Battery life is going on 3 months with moderate use. What's moderate use? I arm every night and 3 - 5 times a day. Take photos 2 - 3 times and watch live view 4 - 5 times a day. Each live view is for one cycle before it times out or asks to continue. Sometimes I'll watch live view for 3 - 4 times continued. Still haven't needed to replace batteries yet. 👍 Update 4: Colder weather is here and another camera needed a reset where you pop the batteries out wait 30secs and pop em back in. Battery still says ok and its going on 3 and a 1/2 months. It first gave me a failed to load warning here n there and that may be a sign you may need to do a reset.\"}\n",

I certainly didn’t want to pay a monthly subscription fee to store and view my recordings.  The sensitivity of the Passive Infrared Sensor is pretty darn good.  It seems to trigger an alert and start a recording when motion is detected within a distance of up to 25 feet.  The recording quality is good both in daylight and night vision modes.  I carefully masked my cameras and painted them and the optional mounting brackets that I purchased so that they match and blend in with the color of the vinyl siding on my house.  My cameras are now much less noticeable when someone approaches my doors.  I recommend getting a set of optional mounting brackets, the Synch module bracket for your electrical plug, and a 64 MB USB drive so that you have everything you need for a good installation and the ability to locally store your saved video clips.'}\n",

These are so much better than the XT2s. I love my XT2s but it always drove me batty that I had to download the clips through the app, one by one. But with the new local storage feature, I simply grab the USB flash drive once a day and download the clips to my laptop. This is what I’ve been waiting for. Right now, it uploads to the USB flash drive once a day but at the end of the year it will be uploaded in real time. It will also have the capability to be uploaded to the USB flash drive manually if I choose. Love that. I’m so happy that I have local storage that I can quickly upload to my laptop.'}\n",

Here are my pros and cons... PROS - Easy to configure to the home network.  Took less than 10 minutes and was easy to understand. - Easy to place.  2 year battery means no wires and (hopefully) 2 years \\'till I have to go up the ladder again. CONS - Motion sensitivity is tough to get just right.  On one night there were several hundred hits, none of which included any visible motion in the frame.  Adjusting the sensitivity down meant no hits at all. - Several mornings the camera was fogged over rendering the photo blurry at best. - Tremendous lag on the live view making the 2 way communication virtually useless.  (Most things run quite fast on our network, so I\\'m blaming the camera.) - This is NOT an always on camera, it only works when activated by motions. Overall, I feel that this would capture the behavior we were monitoring for, should it occur again.  So, for the price and minimal effort involved, it is probably a winner.  It is not, however, the powerful \"Live View\", 2 way communication, camera you may be hoping for.'}\n",

Lobert', 'rating': '4.0', 'helpfulness_rating': '32', 'review': 'Update from 3 stars to 4 and here\\'s why: After my review went up, Haitham at Blink reached out to me. He gave me more tips on camera positioning and apologized again for the defective camera. I\\'ve received a replacement camera as of today and it appears to be working well. They provided a prepaid shipping label to ship back the defective one, a big plus considering some companies try to make you pay to ship back their defective goods. So why 4 and not 5 - to get the cameras working properly, I had to remount three out of the four functioning ones (despite following the rules of not mounting them directly in front of what I wanted to record) and get pretty creative about it, plus literally a couple of hours of calibration time to find the right settings for what I want. The trade off was not covering as much of my property as initially planned. I still don\\'t believe the range is 20-25 feet. These aren\\'t nearly as plug and play as they might seem, but all said, I\\'m no longer considering returning them. Recommendations: use outdoor mounting tape and calibrate your camera(s) before you start drilling holes in things. Don\\'t try to do too much on the app at once - it needs time to communicate with the cloud. I\\'ve had very little issue with the app when I take this into consideration. Don\\'t gripe about paying for cloud storage. Get local storage if you don\\'t like it. That\\'s the way the world\\'s moving. Someone mentioned it didn\\'t accept above a certain gb local storage - I plugged in a 256gb Samsung thumb drive and had no issues. Whether Blink will store that much to it is yet to be determined. Original: Bought a 5 camera system and got one defective one (not sensing motion) - An optimistic 5 stars to customer service who is replacing it after having me do normal trouble shooting items. Now, the reason for the 3 stars - ding about a half a star for having a defective product out of the box. I didn\\'t pay almost $400 to have to deal with that. Ding a star and a half, because despite their \"range\" where you can gray out other areas, I\\'ve messed with them all throughout the day since installing them, and have repeatedly made it down my driveway to my car and back without triggering the camera and have the sensitivity up as high as it\\'ll go. I think the motion detection range is much shorter than the view window. This is a big deal for me, as I expected them to capture anyone coming up to my vehicle. Overall, I wanted much more out of the motion detection. The image is fine when you\\'re within a few feet of them, it\\'s when you\\'re further away that it gets granier (day or night). Not 100% positive if I\\'ll keep them or not just yet.'}\n",

Fairly easy setup (might be a little hard to \"get\" for folks who don\\'t understand that you really need to get the Sync module going first, and that you need to do that by setting it up while it\\'s right next to your router). Nit-pick: The two-cam kit only needs one Sync module. I purchased two, thinking I would need one for each cam. It\\'s not spelled out anywhere (that I noticed) that all you need is actually in the box. Word of warning: If you DO need a separate Synch module, make sure you order the one that works with the Outdoor version of the cams. The XT2 version does not appear to work with the newest \"Outdoor\" models. Request that Blink just put up a dang compatibility chart somewhere in all the marketing gobble-de-goo. So-so: Response time to bring up the live view is too slow for this system to work as a true \"doorbell cam\". In fact, often the \"ping\" notifications are received on phone and Echo WELL after the tripping event has occurred (4 to 5 seconds). Not very good: Night vision is, like, a C+ compared to August and TonTon and Eufy and Arlo (but Blink is nowhere near as expensive either, so there ya go). Not very good: Audio (via the phone app) is not loud enough at the cam. Not very good: No true desktop client. You have to run a pseudo Google app in BlueStacks. Not good at all: No two-way voice comms over Echo? Whaaaat? That should absolutely have be there, IMO. You can access the camera view, but that\\'s it. So....what good is it, then? Big miss, there, Blink. Bottom line: A very inexpensive system that tells you when you have packages (after the fact) and lets you talk to people who are WAITING at your door (in a weird, halting, conversation).

It detects motion behind it and starts to record when there\\'s nothing going on in the direction the camera is pointed. It misses motion completely in the target range sometimes. It senses motion but comes on so late it misses it. Even with reset time at 10 seconds, it doesn\\'t take a second video after 10 seconds. You have the ability to take a picture remotely but 7 of 8 attempts (consistently) give a \"Thumbnail FAILED\" message. The Live video doesn\\'t work at all yet after 2 days testing. The software options have a Lot of bugs.  I don\\'t think they QA\\'ed this software much at all. It\\'s a nice picture of the blink in the rain but don\\'t get the wrong idea...  the camera lense has no offset so when a raindrop hits the lense, the pictures are super blurry.  So you\\'ll need to wipe the lense off every raindrop. I have cheapo $28 trail cameras that work WAY better than these. AND.... they just increased the price of the blink by 30-40%.

But it is definitely not dependable as a security solution. Here are pros and cons... Pros: - Very easy initial setup of sync module and cameras. Just insert batteries, scan the QR code, and it\\'s added. - Installation is quite easy. - Affordable as compared to other wireless cams Cons: - Motion detection is unreliable. I had one camera trained on the front of our vehicles. It would not detect the vehicle leaving the driveway, so no video nor notification when it moves. Also, the same camera would get activated and record but viewing the video there was absolutely nothing moving that would have triggered the recording. - Another cam I had was near my pool equipment, and was constantly being motion-activated due to the heat from the heater. I lowered the sensitivity to overcome this, but then it was not being triggered when someone walked by it. - The \"Retrigger time\" that delays when the next motion-activated recording takes place cannot be set less than 10 seconds. That\\'s more than enough time for something to happen and gets missed in the recording. A savvy bad actor would know this, and possibly be able to avoid being recorded. - The max length of a video is 60 seconds. - The max temp rating is 113F which is not practical in desert climates even in the shade. Also, the highest you can set the high temp alerts is 90F. - Common camera settings like re-trigger time, max recording length, etc. have to be set on each camera individually, not to all or a group of cams. - The Android app is buggy. At one point, it was prompting me to do biometric authentication after each camera setting change. Also, one time there was a \"Dynamic motion detection\" option that showed up and did nothing when tapped. Later, when I tried to find it again, it was no where to me found. I\\'m guess a beta/early adopter feature that wasn\\'t being hidden properly. - With the provided mounting hardware, they are very easy to steal. And given the other bugs with motion detection, etc. chances are you won\\'t get a video of the thief before they grab it and pull it down.'}\n",

Recording doesn't start until the subject is well within the motion detection area, so I  frequently miss what triggered the motion detector. For example, even through my motion detection zone is set to the edge of my driveway, the video doesn’t start recording until I am nearly in my garage and my face is out of view. The app is slow; far too slow to allow you to see and communicate with whoever may be in range of the cameras, so that functionality is useless to me. Plus, the images you see when you open the app aren't actually what the cameras are seeing at that moment; they are old images captured by the cameras, which may have no relation to what is in front of the cameras at the moment. To its credit, Blink contacted me to try to work through the issues and “increase coverage” with two additional cameras, but it was to no avail.  With everything set up, I had an Amazon Fresh delivery this morning that never even triggered the cameras.  This was even after the driver made several visits to my well-lit front porch to drop off six grocery bags.  Not a single alert or video.  Disconcerting, to say the least. Very disappointing purchase. If I could return them, I would, but I have already installed them and tossed out the original packaging.  They’re going to Goodwill and I’m going with Nest.\"}\n",

The only differences I can see between this camera and the XT2 camera in the two-week old system are: 1.  It costs more.  2.  The cloud storage requires a paid subscription starting next year. Installation is easy and only takes a few minutes.  Motion detection very far removed from the camera requires a higher sensitivity setting which results in false alerts.  The picture is very clear and night vision is good.  The attached clip is just a live view from the camera.  No motion was detected. 10/28/2020 A quick update.  After submitting my original review I was contacted by Alex in Blink Customer Service.  Alex sent me a Sync2 controller to enable the local storage option and has patiently worked with me while I made the change.  Since the local storage is to a flash drive through a USB port I ordered a flash drive to use.  I have not received it yet, but no reason to suspect that it won't work. The camera has good video and works well.  It does have two drawbacks that I would prefer it didn't have.  The first is the sensitivity setting is very touchy.  Set it at a higher sensitivity to cover more distance and you get a lot of false alerts.  I live in the country and have been really surprised at the number of visitors we have to our porch and deck in the night.  So far we have a feral cat that is a regular, several raccoons, a groundhog and a deer.  I expect the turkeys next, but they'll come in daylight.  The second is the delay between the time that motion is detected and when an alert is sent out.  It is only 10 or 15 seconds, but it seems like a long time when it happens.  Nothing you can do about that I guess. My last comment is that the Blink Customer Service Department is VERY responsive.  I have been surprised and pleased at the service I have received from them.  I should mention that they came to me first, without my asking.\"}\n",

Second I bought a knock off cam a few months ago and I replaced i with this and I’m not very impressed with it being a premium brand I expected a premium product with premium results. So let’s get into it. First, I purchased this to replace a generic brand camera I had bought a few months ago. The generic camera was rechargeable, had good picture, and I was fairly happy if I was using it just to view but it’s motion detection was garbage it could only detect things a few feet in front of it. So I bought this and the fact that it is battery powered is nice but it seems like it could be rechargeable instead of using two double A batteries!  If you want it set on the best picture quality and the highest night vision you are going to be running through batteries which wouldn’t be an issue if it was rechargeable. Next, the lag is ridiculous the generic cam had about a 1-2 second lag at most this one came in at about 4-5 seconds! I don’t know how you are supposed to use the talk feature when the person was there 5 seconds ago but by the time you get the notification, open the app, and wait for it to load that’s roughly 30 seconds after the motion was detected.  The motion detection is a positive it works very well and I’m pleased with it. Another positive is that it’s very customizable as far as recording time, time between events, and other sensitivity settings. However, turning these to more frequent and more sensitive settings means more power drain and buying more batteries. Picture quality during the day is great but night vision is not great. I thought the lens was dirty but no the night vision is just not very quality. I can see things fairly well like a raccoon that walked in the driveway but if it were a person at my door and I wanted to identify them while the night vision was on I’d be out of luck. It does integrate well with Alexa my echo show 5 immediately worked with it after installing the skill and accessing the camera is a breeze. Maybe I was expecting too much but when a generic brand camera beats a name brand in all but 1 category that’s not good. If the motion detection would’ve worked right on the generic even though it didn’t integrate with Alexa I would be returning the blink. However, the motion detection doesn’t work and if the camera doesn’t alert me to motion it’s practically useless. So I will be keeping the blink and hoping for improvements over time since it is a relatively new product. I will update the review/star rating if things improve or worsen.'}\n",

BLINK is a good company and my experience with customer service was amazing!  Thank you Mr. Weiss. Initial review: When this system works, it is amazing and surpasses my expectations. Problem is, it\\'s not consistent. My front door camera (the most important one of the two) worked great for a day or two but since about 6pm yesterday has failed live views, and not recorded any of the activities in it\\'s range. In-fact 16 hours later, I\\'m still not able to live view nor get any motion detection.  It did notify me that the temperature rose above 40°, thanks camera! What good is a security camera that doesn\\'t work when you need it too? I\\'m waiting to see if customer service is any help, will update as appropriate. I really want to live this but..... On a side note, the blink mini works great and has good night vision, love that little camera. To bad it\\'s indoor only!'}\n",

This claim is based on configuring the camera in a way no one would use it, with severely degraded picture quality, large delays between video captures, lowest motion sensitivity, 5 second max clip length, and no night vision. In other words, how no one would ever use it.  In practice the battery lasts maybe a few months.  The battery life is so bad, that the app will not tell you how much battery is remaining, only that it is \"OK\" Audio Capture Horrible. Basically loud static hiss that sounds like a ham radio from the 50s. If someone speaks loud enough you can make out what they\\'re saying. Motion Detection Again, horrible. It is either incredibly sensitive, picking up essentially nothing, or it picks up nothing at all.  No person detection, as is pretty much standard with most cameras these days. Setup Blink provides zero instructions in the box on how to set up or mount the camera.  You basically have to figure it out by opening the app and getting things wrong.  You open the app, it asks you to scan the camera QR code, then after you do that it will tell you it can\\'t be added because you have to scan the base station first.  Didn\\'t the app know there was no base station?  Unreal. Mounting The mount is absolute junk. No instructions on how to attach the mount or how to secure the camera to anything. Eventually you figure out that the cheap plastic mount just sort of snaps onto the back of the camera, making it easy for anyone to remove. It really should have a more secure threaded mount. Privacy Blink demands that you provide your phone number. Why?  There is no conceivable reason why Blink would need your phone number, and it\\'s just one more thing they will misuse or accidentally give away in a data breach. Overall, a VERY poor wireless camera.'}\n",

Schonauer', 'rating': '4.0', 'helpfulness_rating': '6', 'review': \"This is really two separate systems sold as a “package” yet billed and shipped separately. Blink Outdoor Cameras Set up is easy.  You will need to download the Blink ap onto a device where you can easily set up the cameras.  Each camera is given a generous thumbnail view through on your device where you can check the batter life and temperature.  You can enable motion to detect and fine tune motion detection by blocking areas, “zones” from triggering the camera.  This is a beta feature that appears to work quite nicely if you just cannot avoid a tree or road with traffic from the camera view.  Motion detections sensitivity may be set from 1 to 9.  At 3, shadows from trees cast by car lights on a wall in view of the camera will trip the motion sensor.  You may set the camera to give you alerts when motion is detected and record both sound and video when motion is detected.  Once adjustments are made, you can easily turn on “arm” and off “disarm” the motion detection and recording. (UPDATE:  There is a significant delay between motion detection and beginning of automated recording.  It is possible for people to pass into the camera's view, activating the camera, and then out of the camera's view before recording begins.) The camera has an infrared setting that can be turned on, off, or auto with a low, medium, high intensity level.  The camera is equipped with an infrared light and is limited only by the reach of light, which is easily 20 feet or more. Recording You may choose what events are recorded, motion capture, direct access to the camera (this means that anytime you access the camera from the app it will record), and/or photos.  You can adjust motion capture recording length anywhere from 5 seconds to 60 seconds and make other adjustments (e.g. end clip if motion stops for motion capture).  The recording captures sound as well.  When accessing the camera directly, you are able to communicate through the camera speaker if  you have chosen that option.  Recordings viewable in the Blink app and not easily exported. Direct Access to Camera Accessing the camera can take from 5-10 seconds.  Also, you will not be able to access the camera if it is recording.  That is, if you get a motion alert and have set your camera to record for 10 seconds when “tripped” you will not be able to access the camera until the 10 seconds has passed.  The app will tell you the camera is busy.  This means it can take you up to 15 seconds to access the camera directly.  This is an unfortunate feature and a software fix that terminates motion capture once an attempt to access the camera is made would be nice, especially if you have set the camera to record during direct access.  In a sentence, a manual override would be nice. The fact that you cannot override a motion capture recording as it is happening means it is best to not have the camera armed when you are home if you want quick access after a knock at the door.  If you main purpose is to able talk to visitors, when home or not, then it is best to disarm motion capture or it may take some time to be able to access the camera for this feature. Echo Show 5 After you download the Blink ap and set up your blink camera system, set up is all “plug and play”.  The echo automatically discovered the Blink camera system without a hitch.  The Echo Show 5 will give audio alerts for any camera that is “armed” (e.g. “motion detected at front door”).  Like the app, you will not be able to access the camera through the Echo Show 5 if you have the camera set to record when triggered by motion.  When this happens, when the camera is “busy”, the Echo will simply tell you it cannot do what you are asking.  When the camera is not busy, you can access it directly through the Echo.  HOWEVER, and this no small however, you can only hear audio from the blink camera using the Echo Show 5, but CANNOT communicate WITH the camera using the Echo Show 5.  To speak through the camera, you will need to use the Blink App on a phone or tablet.  Because this was the one of the major reasons for the purchase, I am disappointed.  Hopefully, there is a software fix for this in the future.  This would be a wonderful system for an older person who is confined to bet and does not have an iPhone or tablet next to them at all time.  If the Echo would communicate with the camera speaker, the Echo could be placed bedside for use.\"}\n",

The idea of spending thousands on installing them, running wires, etc was out of the question as well. Recently true wireless cameras have been coming out that have been in my price range so I jumped. The problem I quickly realized was that taking down a camera every week or two to charge is simply not practical. The other issue being that to conserve energy the cameras only record when sensing movement. If they don’t have a great sensor, they don’t record, and that kind of defeats the whole purpose. And lastly, if they have connection issues to the wifi, then they are useless as well. So with all that said, I decided to give these a shot. As expected, these cover all the issues I have had with previous wireless cameras. The battery life is supposed to be two years. I have had them up for two weeks and it still shows as being a full battery. So that part looks good. The motion sensor works great. I have one at my front door facing a sidewalk and street (street is probably 50+ feet away), and my biggest issue is getting too many alerts of movement every time a car passes. With a little fine tuning, there is a setting that allows you to select the areas you want to detect motion. Genius! Setup and connectivity were basic enough, and we are in business. Lastly, getting the Amazon show monitor is a great add. My guess is that whoever designed this, read all the negative reviews on all the other cameras out there, and fixed them. All in all, really great product!'}\n",

I figured with the improvements it would easily perform better than my older blink camera and be a huge improvement right? Wrong. The new camera does take higher quality video and does have better settings for blocking out zones you dont want to record. However, the motion sensor catches about half as much movement as my old camera did, the night vision is darker and shows less detail and the new camera has intermittent connection to my wifi (whereas the old camera was fine). It also doesnt interact with the old app very well and when I get click on an alert from the app that there is a new video it takes me to the live feed of the camera instead of the clip feed, something none of my other cameras do. Overall very frustrating and I recommend keeping your old cameras for as long as possible if you have an OG blink system.

So if your monitoring radius area is of any reasonable size, you need a WiFi mesh and multiple Sync modules.  Then IMHO it is not clear to me the value of this system since if I need that infrastructure, I might as well buy a better camera system that hooks directly into my WiFi mesh such as Google Nest. Update 4:  and the Blink Home app is horrendous.  It shows the time of the video clips in the time zone you are in instead of the time zone the video was taken.  Nest does it right.  And a good 8 hours of the day, video retrieval times are incredibly slow.  I am guessing 11a-7p there is a lot more activity, and video retrieval goes through some cloud network device slowing everything down.  Other times of the day it is fast.  Again, I don’t see this with Nest.  Really wish I hadn’t bought 8 of the Blink cameras. Update 3: my final analysis is 1 star.  These cameras are just flaky.  They miss video, partly because the embedded algorithm cycles the cameras on and off.  I can see the infrared cycle on and off for all the cameras at night.  I develop software, and I suspect this is a power saving optimization.  But the result just misses loads of motion, even on the highest sensitivity setting.  I also have Google Nest cameras, and I wish I had spent all my money on them instead.  They are better at recognition, and if I think something is missing, I can just scroll back since Nest captures all video, not just want Blink thinks I should see - which if incorrect, all is lost.  In a recent support ticket with Blink, they blame my WiFi, and trust me, there isn’t anything wrong with my WiFi, lots of bandwidth to spare uplink and downlink, low latency, very low packet loss.  I have dozens of devices that all work fine, including the Nest devices.  So since 1.5 doesn’t exist, sorry, has to be a 1.  These just don’t capture motion - the most important function of a security camera. Update 2 days later: I bumped up to two stars. The blurry video (especially at night), network dependency on the Sync module, and lack of a continual video recording archive are big misses. Being wireless is a good feature. All in all, probably should spend more money on a better system. I should note I had a good experience with Blink support. I was contacted by Blink support to determine if the problems could be corrected.  Support had me reinstall the cameras which resulted in a firmware update. I am not sure there was much difference.  Support also suggested moving the camera to avoid any undesired light magnification at night. That did help. However the video quality is still blurry at night. Other systems (such as Nest) have quite a bit better video quality although they also cost quite a bit more so something to consider. Original post:  Video quality is horrific, especially with night vision. I was especially surprised with the poor video quality because I bought the Blink Mini earlier this year which has much better video quality (day and night). Add to that a network dependency on the Blink Sync Module 2 which requires continual connectivity or else the system goes “offline”, and this system is awful. The only plus is the system is wireless. But if the video is so poor, it doesn’t matter. I really hoped for far better than this.'}\n",

Now we are up to 10 cams, covering every angle of the house. Here are my findings after using them for almost 4 years (and still buying more): PROS: > #1 video quality is excellent. Day time is a bit better than night, but night vision is as good as it gets with cams.  POSITION of your cam matters a ton. I started out putting them way high up and quickly realized - if you actually want identifying features - they need to be lower. Otherwise... yeah you see someone walking past, but you cant ID anything, so what is the use. > So inexpensive - so easy to integrate. Anytime we have ANYTHING we need to cover, we just order another cam and it literally takes 5 minutes to get it out of the box, batteries in, and added to existing system.. seriously - 5 minutes. > The app is great. Very intuitive. Our first cams had very few \"advanced features\" every time i order new cams, they have improved their features. Now you are able to zoom all the way in to very small areas, to capture certain areas  and exclude others.. For example - old cams you had to block off large sections of the capture area to avoid the cams picking up movement from trees, but now you can pinpoint one little part of a branch on a tree to exclude if its triggering the cam. > Motion detection is very sensitive - but they have it tweaked just about right. It never misses anything, but if you setup your exclusion zones well - you can get it almost perfect. I dont have a lot of false alarms and I\\'m running 10 cams. We have one setup to look at the sidewak, and after much tweaking, we can actually exclude the street... but pick up both sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can setup the app to alert you or not alert you.. you can turn sound on or off on alerts. On windy days I do end up just going into the app and turning off all cams that are setup around lots of trees until the storm is over.. but thats like a few times a year. > Super easy playback and control of cams. It\\'s instant - you can control them in any way, very easily. If I am working on a project in the yard, I dont want my cams on for hours, running out of batteries - so I just go into the app and turn them all off. It takes seconds. Likewise - if i hear a noise at night, super easy to open the app and live view any cam so i can look all around the house and see everything happening outside, from every angle. > Extremely easy to move around. We have had them for years - so we move them around occasionally. I even had mice in our crawlspace under the house at one point and just grabbed one of the cams off the side of the house and stuck it down there so I could catch them at night. Theres no commitment with these - no hard wiring so you can mount them anywhere and taking them on and off the mount takes 2 seconds. > No subscription needed to store clips. thats BIG for us. We would not like blink as much if they changed that. We run a lot of cams and it just stays 100% full storage - we can still access a few weeks worth of video, it just deletes oldest. You can download/save any videos. > Lots of mounting options. You have to buy them separately if you want anything special, but I have 3 different types of mounts - one for trees, one around porches that need to be secured so they cant be taken, and then the standard mounts for cams not at risk of being taken. There are camo skins as well - I have on in a tree that you pretty much cant see unless you know its there. > Customer support is super decent. In the winter of 2018, one of my cams took on a green hue to the image when the temp went down to about 10 degrees outside. I emailed customer service explaining the issue and sent a screenshot and within 24 hours they asked me for the SN of the cam, and did a firmware update that fixed it. I was quite happy with that. CONS: > So while the batteries are awesome because the cams are so easy to move around and deal with... i blow through batteries. Fortunately, i just get 20 packs of AA\\'s, but with 10 cams - even though Blink ~says~ batteries can last a year? it totally depends on usage. So we get LOTS of traffic on our front cams because we live in a busy area and have people walking past all day. I change out the batteries on every one of those front cams once a month. Granted - thats many hundreds of video captures and ideally, we should connect those cams to electricity somehow - that is an option with blink, but I dont mind changing batteries. On the cams in the back yard and side paths - I really can go once or twice a year changing those, except for the ones that catch a lot of foot traffic. So the battery usage is totally dependent on traffic. Personally - the cams are a big deal to me, so i dont mind it at all. Benefits totally outweigh the downsides. > The biggest difference between Blink and some other companies is that i see other people with hardwired cams that can catch EVERYTHING in a continuous fashion, for hours. like the surveillance videos you see online where the cam just happened to catch something happening down the street...Blink doesnt work that way. it only captures immediate video clips, triggered by motion activation. It does store all videos.. you can see something weird in your yard and look back through videos to find out what happened - but it isnt 24 hours of continuous video feed. > You can get gaps in your videos. So it can capture 1 minute of video at a time, but then it takes a small break before it starts capturing again, so if something is happening and its videotaping an event - it will record an entire minute of excellent footage - but then it takes a 5 second break before it starts recording again. that doesnt sound like a long time, and for security it\\'s not normally an issue.. the average bad guy is in and out quickly.. but it is annoying that it takes 5 seconds to re-trigger. So.... 2 minutes of continuous video... but in the middle of that 2 minutes.. a 5 second break. OVERALL - Super high video quality... cams you can move around super easily... a very easy app... I love blink and the upsides far outweigh any downsides. I always recommend it to people when they ask. You can cover your entire house at a super affordable price, you dont need to be rich at all.. Our 3 year old cams are still as good as our brand new ones. The peace of mind the cams bring me is priceless. I know every single thing happening everywhere, all the time outside. The affordability made it possible so that nothing can ever surprise us.'}\n",

Mainly because of battery life. “Two years with standard use” is the specification. However, what Blink considers ‘standard use” is absolutely laughable. ‘Standard Use = 40000 seconds’. Big number, eh? Not really. 40000 seconds = 666.7 minutes = 11.1 hours. So, they consider standard use to be about 5.5 hours PER YEAR to get a 2 year battery life. That’s 55 seconds of recording per day. The reality is, you will get maybe 3 weeks out of a set of batteries. I do like the other features, though. The ability to include the camera system in Alexa routines makes these extremely flexible and useful.  I just wish they represented the battery life in a more realistic way. It’s almost false advertising since they aren’t realistic with their definition of “standard usage”, which in my opinion isn’t standard at all.

Also, they have problems detecting when the battery is actually low. Your camera will stop working because of low battery before it indicates low battery. At best, these are a novelty item. Do not use as a security camera. They might work well enough to monitor something unimportant, like a squirrel feeder, or something.'}\n",

With the zone selection feature, I rarely have false positives. The quality of the video is good. The quality of photos is mediocre. It does work with Alexa. I have mixed feelings about a battery-powered camera vs an a/c powered camera. Mostly, because I want to leave it on for a minute or two to watch. This camera requires \"Continue?\" to be pressed every few seconds. The red light for infrared recording is frustrating. It\\'s definitely a known visual indicator to criminals in determining when a camera picks up movement or when it doesn\\'t. I wish it were hidden as I have the camera ON light disabled by default. The mount is VERY cheap. It\\'s a clip-on plastic mount connecting the camera to the base and not a screw-in mount. Meaning, your $80 camera can easily be taken or knocked down (if within reach). The app is slightly frustrating. When someone gets into the car, the camera records 3 times (this is a setting). I am good with this. When the same person returns, another 3 times are recorded. The app is set up to require the owner to individually watch each recording (at least for a second) before marking it as watched. On a given day, I might have 30 recordings to review. The IOS notification says \"Motion detected at your car\" over and over again. There is no screenshot or link to watch a clip. I have another security camera and a clip is sent with the notification. I decided to go the USB flash drive route instead of a monthly subscription. I asked Blink Support 3 questions about the USB option: 1) How exactly does this work if one does not have a subscription? After the trails end, clips from that device will be saved directly on the sync module 2 flash drive and you will be able to see those clips from the Blink app. That is not yet ready, and it will become available to you once the free trails end. 2) Why are videos not copied to the SD card immediately? Once the trial ends, and if the device is not on the subscription, the clips from that device will be saved immediately on the sync module 2 flash drive. It is the way the system is designed, the only way the clips can go immediately on the sync module 2 flash drive is if the device does not have a subscription plan and that will method will start being available once the free trail ends. 3) How can I access the recordings without ejecting the SD card? Once the free trails ends, you will be able to access the clips that they are saved on the sync module 2 flash drive from the Blink app. ----- I sent a reply to immediately cancel the trial so I could test the USB flash drive functionality and still have a chance to return the product during the extended return window if it does not perform as expected. Blink Support was responsive and for that, I was appreciative.'}\n",

            "{'review_date': 'November 30, 2020', 'handle': 'howie', 'rating': '4.0', 'helpfulness_rating': '3', 'review': 'Due to my answer in the QA section receiving many endorsement, i decided to give it a bit more detailed review after 2 weeks into owning the Blink setup. I came from Simplisafe, and i still do have simplisafe\\'s alarm system, but due to their lack of outdoor camera solution, i finally decided to pull the trigger on the latest Outdoor blink and try out the Mini blink as well. First thing\\'s first, the new Outdoor Blink cam works mostly as advertised but the indoor Blink Mini is junk. Read more about the Mini below. But first the Outdoor (good) Blink Outdoor: Motion recording speed & Delay: The Outdoor cam\\'s trigger time is almost instant, in fact, I noticed that it even records a second before entering the frame. which tells me that it might be doing some kind of constant recording into the cam\\'s onboard volatile memory as cache, and once motion is triggered it starts encoding the data and dumps it onto the cloud. So the trigger time is almost instant. However, note that there is a 5 second delay from what\\'s happening Live vs what you see on your phone. so that delay is between Trigger --> Encode --> Cloud --> Decode. I\"d imagine that if your Cam is connected to a wifi bridge as oppose to directly to the main router, the delay could be longer than 5 seconds. Compare to Simplisafe cam, the Live vs View delay is about the same. and the trigger time is about the same too. Motion sensor & sensor distance. the motion sensor distance in the Outdoor cam is less than 25 ft. despite what the feature ad would tell you. i have 4 Cams (3 outdoor setup at an angle pointing down 45 degree angle, and 1 in the garage looking pretty much straight flat at my car), 3 of the outdoor ones could pretty much trigger 15~20ft out, while the one in the garage struggles to even trigger at 15 ft. You should also take night vision into account. in NV mode, the distance is 5ft shorter. increasing the IR blast in NV will somewhat mitigate the problem but at a cost of battery drain. i tried moving the cam in garage from pointing 45 degree down to looking almost straight horizontal to improve motion sensing to a degree. So if you have trouble with the motion sensor, try that. Compare to Simplisafe\\'s cam, the Simplicam seems to have farther motion sensing distance. But then again, Simplisafe still doesn\\'t have an outdoor solution. Speaker/Mic the speaker and Mic quality is really good. it doesn\\'t sound overly tiny like you would expect and is loud and clear. compare to Simplicam, the Blink Outdoor has better sound and mic. Wifi Wireless i was surprised how well the wireless works. lots of complains in the review about wireless distance, not sure if they\\'re genuine. but my farthest cam is about 80ft away from my main router thought a living room, a dining room and a garage and garage door (just shy of the max 100ft advertised in the spec), i am still able to get above 33% wifi N signal. But i think a lot of this \"might\" depend on the quality of your Wifi router. i spared no expense on my home wifi. So my router is 3x3 beam forming top of the line AC router that also has a very wide 802.11 N coverage.  it can reach far and carry lots of bandwidth. my advice is invest in a quality wifi router with the most bandwidth and range you can afford. Note that the cams and module only supports 802.11 N. Compare to Simplicam, the wifi signal reach is about the same, if not slightly better than the Simplicam. AC Wireless. part of the charm and strength about the Blink Outdoor is its battery powered wireless nature. Only time will tell how long my Cams will last. I will update this review and reflect the score once my first set of battery run out. My gut tells me it\\'ll be less than 2 years, well less. but i\\'d be happy if i can get even 1 year out of those cams. Note that the advertised 2 year battery life from Amazon is based on roughly 2 mins of video footage per day per cam. One of my busiest cam facing out the front door is seeing 2~3 times that amount. Resolution/video quality the resolution of the cam and video compression is really good. compare to those legacy 480p outdoor cams, this was a big step up. but compare to the simplicam, i would say the image looks slightly sharper than the Simplicam. but note that true 1080p resolution is only possible with high quality video record setting, which can chew up your battery and storage. Amazon\\'s 2 year battery life is based on medium setting, which is actually 720p. but even at the medium setting, i still find the image to be very sharp and clear. going from medium to high (1080p) setting yield \"some\" improvement viewing on a smart phone. you likely won\\'t be able to find big difference viewing it on a smartphone unless you view both videos on a large monitor. oh which btw, currently there\\'s no app available for desktop computers. you\\'ll have to either download the footage or pull the backup off your thumb drive to view it on a dekstop. Storage ok, this is the most contentious and messed up part. the ad made you believe that you don\\'t need to subscribe to cloud and able to store locally. what they don\\'t explain to you is that local storage is only a secondary option on top of the cloud subscription. so you CANNOT, at least at the point of this review, store your recordings directly to the USB thumb drive and read off of it directly. how the Blink cam works right now is everything gets dumped to their cloud server, and when you view the footage, it reads off their cloud server. the USB thumb drive is just there to backup \"from their cloud server\" \"once a day\". there is no way for you to have the cams upload recordings directly to the thumb drive locally and view them from your phone wirelessly off the USB Thumbdrive. There\\'re a lot of people asking about this question on forums and, like me, only found this out after the fact. It\\'s not a deal breaker, but it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Why not just come out and say it. It\\'s simply misleading. if you go to their website, and dig, and i mean really dig, you\\'ll find that there is a way to run it without subscription. but any motion trigger or live views will not be recorded. So what\\'s the point of local storage? it\\'s almost like they just want to find a way to cramp that \"local storage\" wording into their ad to sell you the product only to find out that it\\'s a secondary backup on top of a pay subscription. Now onto Blink mini (junk) Blink mini on the other hand. To put it simply is junk or an opportunity wasted. the Blink Mini has a long standing bug that plagued the camera for at least 2 years, and the dev team still hasn\\'t released a fix. The issue with Blink Mini is that it fails to trigger motion recording coming out of night vision mode when you enter the room to turn the lights on. the dev team explained that something to do with the cam goes into freeze mode when it attempts to wake itself out of night vision to do recording. for that reason, it\\'s pretty much trash if you intend on using the Mini as any kind of indoor security cam. I originally intended to use the Mini in my garage to monitor my prized stallion. But i literately would go into my garage and walk up to the car and no motion or recording is triggered. Dev has acknowledged this issue since late 2018 and said in 2019 forum post that firmware update is coming to fix this. it is now end of 2020, i would not count on it.  The only reason i kept my Mini and ordered another Outdoor cam for the garage is so that in any case when we go on vacation, i can set the Mini up in the living room to do live view. But if you\\'re thinking about getting the Mini for motion triggered security cam indoor, forget it. don\\'t say i didn\\'t warn you. Software UI/UX the interface for the app is easy to use and more organized than many other similar services. clips are organized with usable filters at your disposal. the motion sensing manual dead zone configuration is helpful, although likely not too useful if you\\'re using it outdoor, since the \"motion sensor\" distance (not wifi distance)  is well shy of advertised 25ft. OVERALL the new Outdoor blink has a lot going for it. If they can fix their advertisement wording, or better, let us have the option to record directly to the USB Thumb drive and be able to view the recording from our devices directly from the thumbdrive. it\\'ll then be a True local storage solution. the only reason i ditched my Simplicam is because i really wanted to have smart Cams covering my house outdoor. Been 3+ years since Simplisafe said that they would come out with an outdoor solution. But till this day, still nothing. i just got tired of waiting. When i saw the new Blink Outdoor being advertised for Black Friday, i really wanted to give it a try. i would say the barrier to entry is minimal. the Blink hardware given the discount that amazon has been giving out, is worth the shot. Without the deep discounts, i am not so sure. They just need to improve the motion sensor distance coverage, and let us really use the USB thumb drive for storage. In a sea of smart home security market today. Amazon really needs to do more to win over customers and not only that, to keep them there. If they can combine Ring with Blink, i might just ditch my Simplisafe completely and go Ring to combine their alarm system with Blink. If they can do that, i don\\'t mind paying the $10/month subscription. But at its current state, they still have work to do to win over customers. i will update the review on the battery life'}\n",

I’ve had it for two days, and right now, it’s just a glorified motion detector for my offline trail camera, which has better night vision and actually takes full-length videos, which I can’t seem to rely on my Blink camera to do despite it being 15 feet from my router. I live in an old brick building and I’m aware of the limitations of my connection, but the only thing separating my camera from the router is a window and some air. Further, I dislike how the motion alert triggers before the video is available to view—by which I mean, the motion alert takes about 15-20 seconds to hit my phone after the camera is tripped, and even though the clip may only be 2 seconds long (because of the issue of it cutting off), it still takes 1-2 minutes for me to be able to view it. There is a man in my neighborhood stabbing tires; he stabs and runs. IF this Blink camera even managed to capture the footage (which I don’t count on), the guy would be streets over and gone before I could see the motion alert video and call someone. It would be quicker for me to go look out of the window myself than to wait for the video to appear/the feed to connect. My Wyze camera’s motion alerts have video previews in the notification itself and clicking on the notification takes me immediately to that clip. I don’t know. The delay just isn’t ideal, at all. Other things I’m not a fan of: **The video quality isn’t great—fuzzy at night, and in daylight, you barely read stationary license plates. My $40 trail cam is miles better. I was hoping this could be a replacement so I could stop feeding batteries to my trail cam, but the police would never catch anyone with this footage, if the Blink camera even stayed recording long enough to capture it. **The IR light is bright. I’m hoping my camera doesn’t get stolen. It’s very obvious exactly where it is in the dark. The guy stabbing tires also likes to steal cameras; he hasn’t found my trail cam with its non-visible IR, but he may have a Blink camera in his possession if he really feels like it. **I keep the speaker muted. It’s loud—just this deafening overlaying hiss on everything. **I don’t really like the app layout. My Wyze cam has a preview of what the camera last saw on its home, which I can switch to a live feed that runs indefinitely. Blink’s home is blank, and then then live feed view seems to stop after about a minute? Then you have to hop out and reload it? **I don’t like how saved videos scrub. You scrub forward through them and the dark (play skip share live) mask drops over the whole view, obscuring everything you’re trying to see in slow motion. **I can’t view my camera’s saved videos or its live feed when I’m not in my house so far. I get notifications when I’m gone and I can’t see what they’re for. The video just doesn’t load. I guess I won’t know if I have an intruder until they get inside and hit my Wyze cam with person detection (love that it tells me motion vs person); my Wyze cam never fails me, records continuously, and doesn’t cost me a penny in subscriptions (it’s also $25). I should have gone with my gut and gotten another one for outdoors. Currently just unhappy with my purchase. Probably won’t hang on to this camera.'}\n",

False readings are common and almost impossible to stop. You turn the sensitivity down so far that it doesn't pick up anything basically.

I added these cameras mostly for the motion detection and the ability to run on batteries so you can place them where you want without wires. We have 10 of the old XT2 cameras, they all work great, Motion detection, video clips,  great product. Wanted to expand the system, bought the \"New\" version 2 cams only because Amazon does not sell the old version anymore. One camera out of 5 actually works. Four cameras will NOT connect to the synch module no matter what I do. Reset cameras, reset Synch module, pulled batteries, replaced batteries, reset wireless router on and on. 5 phone calls to tech support, NO meaningful help. One camera arrived with dead batteries, other camera drained batteries dead in one day ( Motion detection wasn\\'t even turned on.)  I boxed them up and sent them back. I wish Amazon would have left the product as-is. It took me about 30 minutes to set up the 10 camera XT2 system with NO issues and they work awesome. I really want to add more cameras because we have a real crime problem outside our business. Like I mentioned before, the motion detection and alerts work really well with the OLD version. I feel this system is a great addition to an existing dedicated around-the clock recording DVR surveillance system but it\\'s not really robust enough for full time security recording for a business. I use the BLINK cams to alert me of motion, then I remote in on the 32 CH DVR to really see what\\'s going on in real-time. As motion sensors go, mine work great and always let me know some shady activity is going on in the parking lot.'}\n",

Daytime viewing is good, night is fair. Motion detecting can be tuned to work fairly well but the cameras do take a couple seconds to come online so you miss a lot. So far I would have given this product 4 stars, but it has a major flaw. The system needs to be armed in order for motion detecting and recording to work. However, you cannot use \"live view\" while the system is recording. So this is what happens: I get a notification on my phone that motion is detected at my front door. I try to view or interact with the person at the door but cannot; it says \"system busy\" (because it\\'s recording) I cant view the recording while it\\'s recording, I cant use live view, I cant interact at all. It\\'s useless in this capacity. The only work around is to disarm the system, but then you have no notifications or any idea that there is a person at the door.

But the video still sucks, you can’t record on demand, you still can’t put an SD card in for storage, none of the improvements that I was hoping for. The Wi-Fi range is still very poor as well. I was hoping the new hub would do some thing about that, but I guess all they changed on that was the color.  What these new cameras are is slow. They are slow as molasses. My old XT two camera makes it to three or four Mississippi while I’m waiting for the live video to start, these new ones take to 12. It’s crazy. It’s a lot faster to walk outside when you get an alert then to try and pull it up and see what’s going on.  I think the Wyze V3 that is just out will be better than these and at 1/4 the price.

The cameras work well and are good quality.  I've had no connection problems.  The hardest part was getting the camera set up so they would trigger properly.  They actually do very well, once located properly.  The important thing to remember is that they are triggered by movement across the field of view, and not my movement towards the camera.  This does make proper placement difficult in some locations around the house, but it is possible to do. A word of advice, explore the App.  There really isn't a manual and make sure you experiment with sensitivity, recording, trigger, and wait times, and more importantly with notifications.  Camera's can be turned off individually, or you can disarm the entire device. You can also turn off phone notification in real time. My first plan was to leave notifications on all night.  It turns out we have a lot of indoor/outdoor cats in the neighborhood (including mine) after two nights I found I was receiving too many notifications and decided to just record events that I could share with police if anything happened at night. I can't say anything really about battery life.  But I think 2 years will be optimistic unless you have very, very few triggers. I will be happy if I get 6 months out of them, I will still be ahead of the game for that. My one real complaint is that from reading, (I can't say from practice) that if you want notifications you will have to sign up for a storage account through Amazon, the company that now owns blink.  But the price isn't that bad and you get one month free and then you have to opt in. Again, from what I've read.  My complaint isn't about the price.  But for the life of me, I've searched Amazon, the web and the app and I can't figure out how to set up the account. (It seems to be separate from your Amazon account).  I'm still in my one month free, I'm only assuming that I will get an email with instructions before it runs out. My second complaint is relatively minor. From the home screen I can disable or enable each camera separately and the system as a whole.  I would love to see them move the notifications button to the home screen as well.  I sometimes want to continue recording events without receiving notifications all of the time and it would be easier if I didn't have to go two screens in to do so.\"}\n",

First packaging was great, setup was easy. I had no troubles setting up the system and I don’t like setting up anything electronic. Little disappointed in mounting hardware. Just uses a plastic pressure ring system to hold camera to mount, not impressed with it feels really cheap and like it will break very easily. The cameras themselves seem well built. Image quality for daytime is pretty good but not impressed with night vision of these cameras. At times it is even hard to distinguish between a cat or dog at night. Get a lot of false triggers on the camera I have over driveway, seems to be from sun reflecting off car and driveway itself. Camera at our front door doesn’t give many false hits but has the issue of not triggering until person is 5 feet away from door. Turn the sensitivity up and you get false alarms. Moved camera over garage to take more of a side angle shot of car in driveway and don’t get as many false triggers. Cameras are very picky on their settings, at a level 5 camera may not trigger until someone is right up on it. Move to level 6 and get false triggers. Very annoying. Like the talk feature to talk to whoever is outside near camera, seems to work good in testing. Now for the batteries. Packaging and advertising states up to 2 years battery life. After just a few minutes of setting up cameras and testing them I was already getting messages telling me that batteries won’t last the 2 years are this rate. So with false triggers and actual people or animals triggering the camera you probably won’t get near that 2 year mark, unless you turn sensitivity down rendering camera useless.

I do not regret this purchase. For years I debated whether to get a security camera system because I felt it invades people's privacy somewhat. I have blocked out any areas that were invasive onto other people's properties. Setting the privacy zones is fairly easy in the App. The cameras and sync module are easy to set up, and the Blink App is pretty easy to use. Actually, we housed the outdoor cameras inside metal, yes metal receptacles. I used heavy duty clear tape to hold them in place inside the metal receptacles, then the front plate gets screwed on. We then mounted them  with metal strips, high enough where we could get good views. I wouldn't say they are completely theft proof as we have them, but better than being able to be popped out of the socket and stolen, as with the mounting hardware they come with. The cameras are unusable if reported stolen. The metal boxes we put them  in have not interfered with the wireless signals to my surprise. I did buy a tiny 64 GB usb flash drive to keep in the sync module. It's a little cloudy about the cost of the monthly subscription from Blink. I read some reviews about people having issues with the microphone. So far, ours is working really well - scared a family member, they didn't know where the voice was coming from. That's always fun. I am generally happy with these cameras. So far have had no issues. The placement can be tricky. If you want the best view, you have to try different locations. Caught someone on camera, snooping around the front (in the small-medium city we live in) so these cameras are worth it, in my opinion. I am skeptical of the 2 year battery life, unless maybe the camera settings are set to the absolute minimal so it doesn't use much battery power.

I’d like to say they’re with the extra $120 when not on sale, but I can’t.  They’re slow to connect even when sitting in the same room as the router, and add in walls they’re slower, and don’t always connect. Features that would be nice if they worked: .  60 second duration - only works of the end early isn’t selected, and even then it’s not consistent. .  Backups to thumb drive - gets disabled nearly all the time it’s enabled without a reason. .  Images are not clear.  Yes, you can tell there’s a person there, and only if they’re up on the cameras can you get a good image of the face.  This is with any of the resolution settings. .  Night vision is so bad you can only tell there’s a body there.  Any definition is nonexistent. .  Burns through storage when resolution is set to something almost usable. What’s nice: .  The interface for the cameras is nice. .  Installation is really easy. .  Sending an email to support they reply to questions and will give a suggestion.  Their solution sort of worked in this case. If Samsung still sold their 10 camera system (and hadn’t sold the product line to another company that turned them into garbage) I’d gladly spent $700 for those again.  These are a disappointment, but I’m hopeful the software gets out of what feels like a beta test and becomes something I don’t regret buying. **EDIT** After three months taking away a star, and I'm much more disappointed in the cameras for a few reasons: .  Batteries that came with the cameras do NOT last a year.  Three months seems to be the tipping point between working and not. .  Support will respond, and not necessarily with anything helpful - example - Your wifi signal is not strong enough, your battery is low, and obvious things like that. .  30 second record time does not mean you'll get 30 seconds.  It means you may get 30 seconds or you may get 1 second or something in between. .  The motion sensor seems to have A LOT of false motion alerts, and fills up your storage.  We're lucky if we get three days online and that's with a maximum of 30 second record time. .  With dodgy characters coming to the door, you do NOT have a clear image during the daytime, so don't rely on these if your house is vandalized or broken into. .  Weather in the mid-west messes with the cameras a lot as well.  Cold weather seems to not be friendly to the cameras in the least, and I can't wait to see what happens when the temperatures hit 110F or more. I do regret buying these cameras, but as with anything that's over $300, you're sort of married to it since you spent the money on the disappointment and not on better cameras that you can't go out and buy now.\"}\n",

The Blink rep stated that I need at least or close to 3mbps for outdoor cameras and at least 2mbps for indoor cameras.  Because I live in a somewhat rural area, fast internet or something close to fast internet is far and few between.  Now after paying and installing my 4 cameras, they sit idle with no way of getting them to work.  Even borrowed a jet pack (both ATT and Verizon) and the both didn’t provide the necessary speed(s); again, live in rural area.  With the ATT jet pack or hot spot, I was able to sync up with the Blink servers, but not enough speed to get the cameras to report to the Blink app.  Note that while looking at the Ring cameras, I was able to see that their cameras only need 1mbps to work but 2 would be optimum.  At least they state what someone needs, as far as, required upload speed.  There is hope as my local provider is upgrading the system in a couple of weeks and I might start receiving higher upload speeds.  Until then the cameras will have to sit there and look pretty.'}\n",

IR looks great at night. And the whole setup process was very easy. No issues connecting to wifi or the sync module 2. I do have a few concerns though. My first issue was with the set I bought here from Amazon. Ended up having to return them because the motion detection was not working right on one of the cameras. All the settings were identical to the other camera but the malfunctioning one didn't catch a lot of motion detection that was happening. There were even a few instances where the camera tried to capture motion and sent an alert, but the saved video was just a half second clip of a mostly glitched screen. After returning that set, I got the same 2 camera set from Best Buy and there was a new issue. This time one of the cameras ate through the included batteries in just 2 weeks time. Was doing less than average amounts of recording and only armed between 8pm and 5am. No reason the batteries should have died. Hoping it was just dead batteries, and I replaced them, but if they are dead in another 2 weeks then these cameras are going back too. My last major concern is the cloud subscription and the local storage. The free trial of cloud storage keeps getting extended which is nice, but doesn't allow me to test how well local usb storage will work for these. I have no intention of subscribing for the cloud and I have the sync module 2 with usb but I dont see how it can possibly work without the cloud. On blinks help forums they state that even with just usb storage, people can still view clips with the app. It also says without cloud storage that clips wont save and you can only be directed to a live view upon detecting motion. And In the app it says clips can only be backed up to usb once a day. So if I dont subscribe to the cloud to record the initial video and the usb only activates once a day to copy cloud videos, how can I possibly just use usb storage? There are no options anywhere in the app to save new recordings directly to usb or to view them from there. Only time will tell if they sort these issues and various others, but its my recommendation to hold off on purchasing blink cameras until blink gets the issues worked out and also provides clearer statements on how this is all going to work.\"}\n",

The iPad app works great, and is native for iPad. Live view and the very useful \"snapshot\" option seem to work well. Image quality seems fine. No complaints even with bright sun in the frame I can still see things. (\"Snapshot\" images are still video-compressed. If they were straight low-compression JPEG, I\\'d give the camera 5 stars.) Cool feature: It\\'ll take a picture every hour and create a time lapse of the day. So even if there aren\\'t any events, you can still get a view of how things are going (\"Photo Capture\"). This feature alone earns it an extra star. Detection is inconsistent. My experience is far better than some other reviewers. Missed a car on the street but caught a person (much smaller in the camera) walking by. Added an extra camera and got better results--more coverage means better detection. A few false alarms (not annoyingly so, maybe every few days). Perhaps the delay between event and clip caused me to miss it. Cannot show live and record a clip at the same time. This is a major flaw -- if someone comes up to the door, I want to see what\\'s happening now, not 30 seconds from now when the clip has finished recording.

You can visibly make out maybe 5-10 in front of the camera (depending of course on your placement, etc.), but anything beyond turns into a big grey blur. - Charging monthly for video storage?  Charging monthly for everything is the new scam.  If you must use this device, buy the $20 USB stick / dock accessory and use that local storage for free.

I don't normally write reviews but I'm really bothered by what I'm seeing on the Blink message boards by customers that are having trouble connecting. When a customer calls for help, they're being told that the problem is not with Blink, but with the customers router. This is absolutely 100% misleading. If you're having problems connecting, the issue is not with your router but with the code that was written to connect to your router. Blink needs to be upfront about this issue and work to resolve it. Now I'll elaborate on my claim that this is just poorly written code. I was able to see the Sync Module connect to my router successfully, then fail shortly afterwards. It appears to be trying something for the initial connection that works on older routers but not on newer ones. I can't imagine that the QA team that worked on this product didn't use a variety of routers before passing the release. The workaround is to create a 2nd Wi-Fi connection with the same SSID. You can use a cell hotspot or older router for the 2nd connection. Attempt to connect the Sync Module to the 2nd Wi-Fi connection. If you are able to get it to update its Firmware and go online, you can shut down this 2nd Wi-Fi connection and the Sync Module will successfully connect to your router. The fact that it's able to connect and work just fine on your router after tricking it into an initial connection, seems to prove that the issue is NOT related to the router. If the router was misconfigured it would not work after tricking it. If the router is simply incompatible then Blink should list the compatible routers in the description.\"}\n",

I spent half the day with reps emailing asking WHERE can I SEE my vids in the cloud. Now there is automatic play back on the app but I wanted to know if this was a month from now and I need to see whose dog is taking a crap in my yard and need to go back to two weeks (example) WHERE do I go to see it (as I have no intention of keeping months worth of video in the app I\\'d delete it on purpose or accident) Apparently there is NO where it would be still saved if you delete it on the app. Because after asking pointedly 4 times WHERE is the cloud storage site etc nothing.  Now I don\\'t know if that was just the \"free trial\" or if I the rep was very uniformed but a week in I don\\'t don\\'t have anything. Here is the thing I want to SEE how I can and can\\'t do and what value if any the cloud storage provides me and I can\\'t do that if I can\\'t ACCESS it during the 30 days free and last issue that is MY fault.

Why I don\\'t want to do that is: -I may move before the year is out. - I really don\\'t know how long the batteries are going to last and then I\\'d have to figure out a way to get up there and take the camera down and put it up -To much hassle and would take a while So in the meantime until I figure out if I want her to do that (put them up) or not I decided to put them in my windows.  in the day time GREAT pics and live BUT for cams to work inside a window they need to detect pixel movement these work on IR so when night came I\\'m getting messages as I get a snack. If I turn the lights out in the kitchen and turn off the IR then you can see outside. other than that it doesn\\'t detect ANY motion from OUTSIDE so it\\'s a waste for me (right now) as far as protection in the day or night. It\\'s basically right now a camera (not even video) doorbell. Just allowing me to see what is going on outside when I actively press the button. So not horrible but not really useful to what I needed. By the time I hear the amazon driver and my lag of live video starts they are TOTOALLY gone.

In reading about the outdoor cam and what was needed I ordered the cam kit and a sync module. We got the sync module set up and went to set up the cam and I was surprised to find a sync module in the cam box. Ok, then. money wasted, but I could always return the separate module.  But thankfully I have set up security cams from another company (one that does not yet have outdoor cams that are not hard-wired) or I would have been lost, lots of small steps not noted.  Had multiple problems holding a signal from the WiFi and the module has to be really close to the router which is not where I wanted it, but not that big of a deal. But then the camera didn\\'t want to be more than 30 feet away. Well, still workable.... we are adaptable. Anyway, got the cam synced up and walked outside to place it noting the 30 foot range issue. It shut down and asked if I wanted to save the video. Figured I had hit something wrong, opted to delete video and went to view thru the cam. Same deal. Was totally unable to just watch what was going on through it, seems it only can be viewed when it alerts (?) - or if there is a way to do that, it is hidden somewhere in the non-existent owners manual.  After a lot of \"do not save/delete\" later we managed to quickly hold it up to see where to mount it. Decided finally on nowhere. We could only see less than half the back yard and while it was clearer than what we have, it wasn\\'t that much clearer to replace our indoor cam looking out the window. It did back to back alerts pretty quickly even thought there was about a 4-5 second delay. It is fixed position which wouldn\\'t be bad if it had more width and depth. I guess we are spoiled with our current cam - we can watch the yard, get alerts, review the past 72 hours and record off the reviews if needed and see a much much larger part of the yard both to the sides and the depth (and move it for what we can\\'t see) even though it sits inside on the window sill and it can be viewed on multiple cell phones at the same time. I knew we\\'d have to sacrifice the panning ability and possibly the multiple accounts/phones issue but didn\\'t expect to lose so much by \\'upgrading\\'. Sending the whole mess back. BTW, we never did figure out how to attach the mount to the camera, it did\\'t want to  thread it into the spot where the screw is holding the back of the camera. Nope. Not gonna argue with it. I\\'ll wait for my company to get a non-hard-wire outdoor cam!  If you have a small area to cover and only want to catch alerts and not have the ability to self-monitor the area, this would probably work for you.

The big one - you cannot have some parts of the system armed for motion detection and others not WHEN running under the scheduler. You can only do this manually (useless as you have to remember to do it) or by having multiple Sync units (@ $35 each). With 5 cameras I have worked out I would need an additional 3 Syncs to get the behavior I want through the day. And I was planning to add 3 more cameras, which would effectively take me to 6 zones (2 more Syncs). The obvious one - I am sat at my computer most of the day - why can't I view my Blink cameras on my desktop - in a browser? Answer, with convoluted Android emulation but this should just be a feature, people have been asking for it almost from day 1. Battery life for high traffic areas will require power, factor this in (cost, and location) - and the design means threading a micro-USB connector through to the camera. Two of my cameras I expected this to be an issue, a third is getting a High Usage warning from the app, which I'd not expected. Lots of confusion over cloud/local - AFAICT the switch to allow Local storage only has not been made (as the apps do not know how to talk directly to local storage, and I think the camera firmware probably does not either). So we'll see what happens when they pull the plug on the free trial cloud storage ... Been impressed with the functional range of the wifi (and Sync connection which it is claimed is a separate connection - not sure). Motion detection is good - no false positives using it's Medium sensitivity. Night vision could do with more 'range' - not sure if that is the sensor or the IR. Overall very nice cameras, which don't quite compete with dedicated security systems in the two main functional areas I started this review with.\"}\n",

Taken just after dusk looking west - slight daylight left.  Note the clarity of the near landscape lights and the blotchy blurring as distance increases.  This is not unusual in night shots.  I have a three year old EZVIZ 720p system and two trail cams and this is acceptable resolution from a small battery operated camera.  The IR range is not far but is adequate for a porch camera.  The dynamic range tends to blow the highlights if IR too much, so there\\'s a setting for that.  These are probably not building security cameras - my ezviz has further IR reach and less blotchyness (noise reduction in blink app?).  I have the Blink on my front porch and will probably add another.  Due to the wide angle, people wearing hats cannot be seen clearly if they don\\'t want to be. I wrote another review of the Echo Show 8 and Blink Mini bundle in which I detailed my lack of two way audio with the Blink cameras.  The short version is that the 5, 7, 9th generation Fire tablets as well as Android 5 phones will not support audio from user to the camera speaker.  This reduces usefulness of a door camera if you can\\'t tell the solicitors \"we don\\'t want any\". Note that these are battery operated cameras and you will receive over-use warnings if used for frequent live view or too many motion detections.  This is to help with battery management, but means it\\'s not a good choice for a pet cam. I bought four of these, but can only find a use for two.

It constantly saves internally those seconds just prior to the motion detection, so that the recorded clip actually starts a second (or two) prior to the motion detection.  For those iPhone users, it\\'s similar concept as the Live Photo feature that includes 1.5 seconds prior to taking your picture. I assumed since Blink is an Amazon company, it would use one of the best features that was implemented in CloudCam...and considered using my CloudCam with a dust/moisture-proof case but decided to try this Blink outdoor because of the battery-based unit. Blink, if you\\'re reading this consider adding this feature and you will get a lot more customer.  Right now, unless a subject stays in the view for a quite some time I only see after the fact. It really defeats the purpose of this camera. Update: Very next morning I noticed I was not getting any notification all night/early morning.  When I tried live view, I kept getting \"Live View Failed\" or \"System is busy, please wait\".  Called tech support and after allowing her to access my account she noticed the camera had an \"error code\" and she needed to \"reboot\" the camera.  After that, I was able to access live view. Note to Blink development team: The app SHOULD indicate this AND this \"reboot\" feature should also be available in the app. I have to mention that the tech support person was helpful and efficient to clear this issue. However, the sensitivity is another story.  I have my CloudCam virtually next to Blink, except it\\'s behind a window.  The CloudCam, as always, captured all movements, including vehicles passing.  Even though I have set the sensitivity to the highest setting, Blink fails to even sense any.  When I walk across the field of view, Blink only senses after I\\'m ALREADY 1/3 into the camera view, whereas CloudCam sensed it as soon as I\\'m in the view.  I already purchased an IP65 case (dust/moisture-resistant) to put my CloudCam.  As much as I\\'d rather use Blink for outdoor use, Blink may not be the answer.

Battery life is not at all good without life extending accessories, and even then the higher quality settings are still nearly unuseable due to battery drain. Setup has to be done very carefully to minimize unnecessary recording events or the battery dies incredibly fast. Battery lasted a single day with my initial settings and camera angle. (Picking up my dogs a lot in the backyard and roommates smoking out front) Doing some digging, the 2 year battery life claim is based on \"roughly 70 seconds per day\" but that is also on minimum settings. Lithium batteries are \"required\" most likely due to them being better at handling more extreme temperatures. The app feels bare and unpolished compared to Ring, though it does have plenty of features and settings. On max settings it sees very well at night, and it has a good image, not quite as clean looking as the Ring doorbell, but almost. There isn\\'t an invite option for multiple users like ring has so you have to log everyone who needs access into your account, and the camera is unavailable (busy) if someone else is viewing.

I'd be afraid that they may snap off at some point. I purchased a set of brackets that both screw on and protect the entire camera.

If the wifi signal from the base unit could be extended some, it might be one of the better ones on the market. As it stands however, all other features considered, they are in line with the other brand cameras I have that were $50-$100 more for the same 2 camera + base package. They pick up motion better, they consistently STAY connected to the network (something my other cameras have an issue with in near freezing weather), and have a interface that is easy to navigate, although could still use some refinement.  Putting the download option in the main area would be better than having to open each video to do it. Or at least let us check a box next to each video and bulk download. One thing that I feel *could* make this system better is to offer some weather proof plugs themselves, instead of buying third party ones that are hit or miss as to whether they work. Storage size is sufficient for those cameras that do not have a LOT of foot traffic.  For those that do, you have the option of having a schedule to arm/disarm the cameras during those times of the day you may not be home or disable when you don\\'t need it to be recorded. For those wondering about the battery life, the 2 year claim is based on a LOW foot traffic area.  I had mine where it got 100-200 activations per day and the batteries lasted about 2 months.  My camera watching my workshop that gets very minimal foot traffic has been running since Sept 2020 (I\\'m writing this on 2 JAN 2021) and I have not yet had a low battery warning.  (It died in Feb 2021) So consider that when purchasing.  Using the above mentioned scheduling will obviously help with battery life.  I also just ordered a 2 pack of third-party outdoor power cords to make this problem obsolete.  The 1 camera I have indoors is using an old Arlo charging cord for power (micro-USB).  If we lose power due to a storm, I\\'ll just go back to batteries for the cameras and power the outlet for the base station, router & modem off the generator. I liked the QR code linking to the base unit this system uses (QR code is inside the battery compartment).  My other system requires having the base & camera within a few ft and pressing sync on both at the same time.  This system uses a QR code to link them to the base unit and the base unit can be anywhere within reach of it\\'s signal to the camera and they link up.  So you can potentially place it in it\\'s permanent location to link them up. They recently changed how the devices show up on your router device too.  It used to show as a Chinese name starting with a Z (I didn\\'t write it down at the time) but checking today, it now shows up as \"blink_sync_module\".  The cameras now show as inactive DHCP connections. Overall, the range is the same as with any other cameras, it stays connected better, seems to activate better, and is slightly cheaper. If the download option was improved, and the way to connect to the mount was improved (it needs lots of pressure to click into a tight, round socket), it would be a shoe-in for best camera.'}\n",

It’s a toy at best, period. Was seriously fooled by such high rating. Amazon deal was sweet during the holidays and the echo show packaged is a steal. There is a lengthy list of problems and limitations I see in a month of use. Firstly setting it up wasn’t any challenging. The setup was well guided on the application. Had to position the camera as appropriate and screw in the mount on which the camera is plugged. Challenges * It will easily set off the high usage warning if there are 3-4 motion alerts in a day and warns me that the battery won’t last long if the camera triggers so often. Really? Then why did you design the system with such a poor battery. * There is no way to record motion detected when the system is disarmed. This means I cannot keep it armed during the day. Each time i step out I would get an alert. This forced me to disable motion detection on the day. So what if someone trespasses during the day, or someone steals my package when I’m inside my home? I would prefer to have a clip recorded even though I am not alerted. * The motion alert settings are tricky. Non intuitive and not user friendly. Why complicate the issue with “Retrigger time”, “clip length” and “end clip early if motion stops”. It’s such a mess. Motion detection camera should stay recording until motion ceases, common sense isn’t it. There is no way to configure this damn thing to do that.  I think they are over doing things here because of one big design flaw - insufficient battery capacity. * Zone selection function is still beta and never worked well. It picks up some portion of the side walk even though I have disabled the zone.  It’s hard for anyone to position the camera in a way where it picks up nothing in the public zone. If the zone selection is still in beta, I don’t understand why this product was even released. * Shadow of someone walking on the side walk or a head light of my neighbors car flashing on my driveway will trigger motion detection. That’s insane, tons of false triggers. Motion sensor should be a motion sensor not a light intensity sensor. * Video quality is decent but not good. You would barely recognize someone if he or she is more than 10 feet away. Night vision is sub par. * Alexa integration is poor. Not many intuitive commands. Why does this need a separate skill when it’s all integrated in the same Amazon platform. Each time you need to say “Alexa, ask Blink to .....” * Cannot control individual cameras through Alexa, you have to arm or disarm all cameras. No option to selectively arm only one of them. * Not reliable: Fails you when you need it the most. There was someone knocking on our door at 11 pm and I really needed this thing to work. When I said “Alexa show me the front door camera”, I see 3 dots blinking on the Echo show and after 10-15 sec a message pops up saying “something went wrong”.  Damn... Tried asking it again a DN the same repeats. * The lag is super annoying. There’s at least a 3-5 sec delay in seeing live visuals on the echo show. * Photo capture option takes one picture every hour. What is that going to help anyone with? It should be at least like a picture every minute to be of any use. * I have seen false temperature alerts. My weather station reported max of 72. But I got a high temperature alert on the camera which I have set to 90F. This happened once so far. Overall I still love to experiment with this and give it more time to see how it can help me though the advantage is minuscule. However if looking for a serious security requirement, which has to be robust as well as reliable in times of need, this is not the right choice. Edit: Feb 2021. Last few weeks there have not been any false triggers. The zone selection function has fixed itself automatically, works as expected. There may have been an update in the background that fixed the issue. Upgraded to 3* Edit: April 2021 To my surprise I received a email saying my subscription would soon expire. Really? Did I have a subscription all this while? I didn’t know. They never told me. Would I not get access to recordings of motion detection here after? If not this is piece of garbage. Will update when I find out. Downgraded to 1* - Not because they have a subscription, but because they never told me when I bought it, that so many features would be curtailed without subscription. The product page says only cloud storage needs subscription. But their subscription page has a whole lot of features which apparently would not work without a subscription.'}\n",

I don\\'t know about you, but if anything serious was happening, both of these features are unacceptable. -It gets worse. You can only record the footage you see for those few seconds!

This version is much easier to open the back of over the first and second generation cameras (which I also own) once one sees the screw structure. Also if one is grandfathered in, it's easy to add either cameras to existing sync modules or new sync modules--or the new indoor plug-in mini cameras--to an existing account, all at no charge (other than purchasing the cameras of course). I have several different brands of cameras and the Blinks are my favorites. And Blink support is extremely helpful as well. So I've bumped my review up to five stars. Update: I am really impressed that someone from Blink reached out to me via email with a link that shows how to remove the back AND explains that the tool is a right-angle adapter! Now if only that documentation had been easily findable when I first needed it, I'd give this five stars as I really do like my Blink cameras. Original: I have numerous Blink cameras, from the first generation through the Mini and this new outdoor model. These new outdoor cameras have the worst design ever! At first it was impossible to remove the back to insert (and later to change) the batteries. Furthermore, there's a stupid little black tool that is supposed to be used for this process--a tool that I imagine most people will lose over time. I finally figured out that by turning the back piece to a certain point the cover fell off, but this isn't obvious, isn't intuitive based on other Blink cameras, and isn't documented anywhere I could find online or in the package.\"}\n",

While its good you have this feature, it would be nice to have a better speaker. -Motion detection. It comes factory set at 5. You need to turn it up to at least 7 so you detect people from afar. -Dely in accessing the cameras when a detection is made. There is a sometimes close to a minute you need to wait to access the camera. -Pan tilt zoom (PTX) Wish they would make a model where you can PTZ.\"}\n",

I do want to note that I purchased this while offered on sale on Amazon’s deals page. What I like: I looked at the Ring, but it was a bit more expensive, and I didn’t want to replace my doorbell. I would not claim that the Blink is superior, just that it might be a good fit for cost and simplicity, without replacing your doorbell. So far it seems to work pretty well. The picture is really clear during the day. The night vision is not great, but is okay; and a good value for the price. I was able to adjust the sensitivity down because I live in a high density development, and that has worked well. It picks up anyone on my property, but is not triggering on my neighbors’ property. Otherwise, it seems to have a good range- I just needed to limit that in my location. If you read the directions, it isn’t hard to set up. The box comes with the essentials you need, including the sync module. The app is pretty easy to use. I own Echo devices, so it is convenient that it works with them. Things to be aware of: The system has already alerted me that the battery will not last the advertised two years in one of the cameras. So just know that the two year timeframe is for low usage. It isn’t terribly difficult to change the battery, but it’s enough of a pain I wouldn’t want to have to do it often. You can reduce the sensitivity or disarm the system to reduce usage; but not using it defeats the purpose, so there’s a limit to what you might want to do there. I highly recommend that you test the camera placement before drilling holes to permanently mount it. If you have vinyl siding, the clips sold on Amazon work great for this purpose. I used those and was able to adjust the placement until I found the best spot. (I originally put it up too high, and was glad I could easily lower it.) You get what you pay for- this is an affordable system that works well if you want something basic that is easy to install and to use. If you are looking for something more than that, you may be disappointed. Since that is exactly what I wanted, I am very happy with my purchase.'}\n",
            "{'review_date': 'December 18, 2020', 'handle': 'William Tell', 'rating': '4.0', 'helpfulness_rating': '', 'review': 'I added 1 Outdoor to an existing 3 camera XT2 system. I super appreciate that the Outdoor clips are grandfathered into the free cloud storage. I realize that $3 a month is not much, but it adds up over time, and might well increase over time. Maybe the new local storage would be good enough? The difference between XT2 and Outdoor is mainly the local storage vs paid cloud storage in the Outdoor sync module, where the XT2 sync module only had free cloud storage. Free cloud storage is much better in my opinion. It is why I bought a SkyBell and not a Ring doorbell - and I\\'ve been very happy with that choice. The 2 cameras are almost indistinguishable. The only difference I\\'ve found is the \"Photo Capture\" feature in the Outdoor. I tried it for a week and it had no value for me, so I turned it off It is supposed to make a still picture every hour and turn that into a status clip once a day. But if you get a motion clip you are supposed to get the hourly photos as a clip at that time, and then the 24 hour restarts. What really happens on a camera that gets multiple clips a day is you get random dumps of one hour photos from time to time. They by definition show nothing of interest, so they are just a waste of time. The great thing about the Blink cameras are their price point. If they didn\\'t work at all, it wouldn\\'t hurt much. As it is they work amazingly well, for being very inexpensive. As I\\'ve used them for a year I\\'ve come to dislike several things about them. If I could buy a system for twice the price that fixed these problems, I would. But it is not clear to me that there is such a system out there. (The only things of real interest on the cameras are when deliveries were made and the unexpected amount of wildlife that walks by. It is bothersome the number of times I know I walked by a camera and it didn\\'t trigger, but it all has to do with the sensitivity setting. I have a sidewalk and a street that are in the camera\\'s field of vision, and they clearly set it off when the sensitivity is high enough that all the activity in my driveway is caught. I\\'ve just bought a new mount for the camera so I can aim it down more so that it only sees the driveway, I\\'m hoping that helps.) The things I dislike the most are the motion detection and the night vision. The motion detection is supposed to be selectively settable, so you can make the trigger not happen in certain areas. I\\'ve had close to zero luck with this feature. I\\'ve read that the PIR detectors cover a much larger area than the picture, thus it is very imprecise what motion areas are being blocked. But my experience is that the selective block is not reliable. Turning down the sensitivity does cut down on the bogus clips, but it also causes the camera to miss valid clips. I wish that the selective trigger zones actually worked. Another problem with motion detection is that it takes awhile. So a slow moving object is much more likely to be well captured in a clip, where a person walking quickly through the frame will often only be see as they walk out of the frame. The night vision has three light setting, low, medium, and high. If the light is too high, the pictured moving object becomes a bright white apparition. If the setting is too low the moving object cannot be seen. Which light is needed depends on how far the moving object is from your camera. Since all moving objects in front of my cameras are not at the same distance, only the one that happen to be at the right distance for the medium setting are well lit. And then they are black and white, which is OK, but never great. I don\\'t know how much it would cost to make the IR lighting auto adjust, but it would be worth some $. So they work pretty well in the daylight, and marginally well at night. They have their flaws, but you can have a 3 camera system for under $200. Another thing I\\'ve been happy about is the battery life. I figured I\\'d never get 2 years, but I was relieved when my first set lasted a bit better than half a year, and the replacements are still fine at just shy of the 1 year mark. There isn\\'t a battery percentage like on a cell phone, they just register as OK until a few days before they quit working. So I could be close to another swap out. I get probably 10 clips a day on my front of the house cameras, and the app warns me all the time that there is too much action for the batteries to last. So I\\'ve been relieved to get half a year. My backyard camera gets a lot less action, so its batteries last much better. The new camera is in a tree facing the house, and it triggers a lot less, so it may last better. We\\'ll see.'}\n",

Why i give 2 stars is because i am very upset and disappointed in its power supply! Says 2 year battery life! Ha thats a joke! Iv barely had these cameras 2 months and the batteries already need replaced! I got these to monitor my back yard and front and eventually need a camera for the side, but I now need to look into a different brand of camera i guess. Very upset because i also got these to go with the echo show and it shows the cameras on screen. I have a high amount of foot and car trafic around my home and i want to be able to monitor 24/7 and these cameras dont really allow for that. If it truly had a 2 year battery life, then its function of only recording very short clips then waiting 10 seconds before switching back on to record again, would be worth the hassle of going through millions of clips, instead of being able to view a whole 24 hrs in fast forward then delete a whole 24 hrs at once. All you have is a very limited choice of \"seconds\" options to choose from. Then there\\'s the gap of waiting 10 seconds to start recording again even if theres still motion going on, it only takes 10 seconds for someone to steal a package off my porch and be out of sight before the camera would even catch it. Say the camera senses someone walking up to or past your house and say they have intent to steal a package on your porch, ( which happens a lot more than you\\'d think), &per the devices instructions to make battery last you have it set to a 5 second clip, well then the camera only catches those few seconds of someone approaching then shuts off for 10 seconds and in that time you wouldnt be able to see or capture the thief on camera! And theyd be clean gone dodged a corner and you dont get any proof of thieves or hoodlums on your property! This is one of the main reasons i need an outdoor camera to begin with. Also needed this for spotting which animals are coming into our yard. See lots of feral cats, coons, possums, &dogs. I like to help doggos or lost cats who come to me, to find their homes and owners, so having constant monitoring in my back yard is also a necessary function needed of a camera. These cameras are kind of a fail for me. 😓 was really looking forward to using these over the next two years but apparently at the recording rate for which i need them to do, it just isnt possible. At this rate Amazon and Blink need to supply unlimited restock of these batteries for all customers because this is just ridiculous And the chincy usb cord they include is also a joke!

Pretty decent signal range from the sync module Very good motion detection, almost instant (within 20-25 feet) Push notifications come within 1-2 seconds of motion detection Cons: Night vision clips of movement are worthless, even at highest settings (which degrade battery life). The only useful thing is being notified that something is moving. Fine if you're home, but if you're away- would be worthless to anyone trying to identify a person if there's a break in or other trouble. Motion recording during the day, even at highest setting is acceptable. You could ID a person easily, however I am extremely disappointed that you cant read a license plate from 25 ft away in your driveway. Placement of cameras is limited by not only your wifi signal, but also the signal strength between the camera and sync module. The camera MUST have a strong signal to both. Alerts come at random times. If there's motion detected, I receive these almost instantly. However, I receive random clips throughout the day which are over 24 hrs old. Finally, the motion sensors are very limited. The product states the sensors have a 25 foot range, but in my testing over the past week it's closer to 20'. This can't even cover my carport or back patio. Bottom line: I paid $400 for the 5 camera system based on a friends recommendation. His needs and expectations are obviously different from mine. You get what you pay for. If you're ok with the above points, it's a decent system for the money and ease of install IF you have a very small area you want to cover. I will be returning this system. Update: Change from 2 to 3 stars w/ 5 star customer service Blink customer service is top notch. They reached out to me instantly, and have been providing continuous support to try and resolve my issues. I have to state that this is the best customer service experience I’ve had in years. Unfortunately, I will still be returning the cameras, but in fairness have to say that my expectations were unrealistic with some of the features. For comparison, I have installed a few Lorex WiFi cameras that are also 1080p, but these are hard wired for power. The night vision is a tad bit sharper, but not a lot. Day time video is about the same as the Blink cameras. I still can’t read a license plate from 25”. The major difference is they constantly record to a micro SD card in the camera vs only when a motion event is triggered, and they connect to live view faster. The Blink app IMHO is also better than the Lorex Home app. Bottom line: If you’re looking for a completely wire free system, and need to cover smaller areas like a typical front porch, this would be a very good option. If you’re trying to cover much larger area’s like me and expecting crystal clear video, you’ll need a hard wired 4K system and DVR/NVR. Finally, the random clips I was receiving throughout the day were caused by enabling the “photo capture feature in the camera settings. With this turned on, the camera takes a photo every hour, and sends them to you in a clip roll. Turning this off solved this for me.\"}\n",

I'd say lag time is about 6 seconds from Echo Show to visual,  but it's what you get when you have to connect to their server (much like Ring). Great concept with batteries and two screw setup, but you get what you pay for, don't expect grade A security cameras.\"}\n",

Also the settings suck - you only have the option to record up to one minute after sensing motion, and the reset time has a minimum if 10 seconds. There is no option for continuous recording as long as motion is sensed. Really disappointed in this unit and would suggest you look elsewhere.'}\n",

I got the 5 pack bundle for ~250. At least I can get a quick visual while not home. The settings seem great upon first look, but they seem to do whatever they want. I have it on the highest quality night vision and still just see black when it’s triggered. Would not depend on these recording any quality images or video of burglaries, or using as the sole source of home security...These paired with a standard home security system on doors and windows along with a good firearm would be sufficient.'}\n",

An issue I have is the motion detection. There is a setting to change how sensitive it is, but if I set mine any higher it alerts me to every leaf blowing across the screen, no thanks. The issue with mine, is on the attached picture, I bought this camera to watch my driveway and front porch area. I have a camper that sits in my driveway, but the camera does not pick up any motion near this camper. I partially bought this camera to make sure that the camper wouldn’t be stolen, because even though it is locked, that doesn’t stop people. The motion it picks up only goes about 5-6 feet past my porch area. So now I am going to need to invest in another camera to watch the same exact area...just closer to the camper. And I don’t want to move the one from my front door since I want that area covered too.

Motion alerts trigger as expected and the live view response time is about 7 seconds.  Actually, when I ask Alexa to show the live view on my Fire TV, it seems to load faster than the phone app.  Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the early notification still isn't fast enough, but it's a beta feature so can't really complain.  Overall, satisfied with this purchase. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I got this camera because Alexa can announce when motion is detected and I can view the live feed on my Fire TV.  I swapped out an old (but very reliable) Blink XT on my front porch. Unfortunately, this new camera’s performance is shockingly bad, even with excellent connections to WIFI and the sync module.  Live view takes 12-14 seconds (my XT took 4 seconds); of the 5 visitors to my front porch yesterday, 2 weren’t detected by the camera AT ALL, and 1 triggered a motion clip after the person was already out of sight (so 2 out of 5 worked just fine).  At 5AM this morning, I was awakened by Alexa announcing “motion detected on porch”, only to see a recorded video clip with NO motion at all…maybe a fly flew by?  Very disappointed.  I’ll tweak the app settings to see if I can improve the motion detection, but there’s nothing I can do about the live view response time.  Does no good to get the early motion alert if the person's gone before I can pull up the live view.  I’m tempted to dust off and re-install the old XT (BTW, it was installed in November 2017 and still running on the original batteries!).  This new camera has a long return window, though, so maybe I’ll wait a few weeks to see if there’s a major firmware update.  Buyer beware!\"}\n",

Install the mount to the camera beforehand as there is plenty of room to get to the two screws the wall mount. The app was simple to load and just point your camera at each q code label inside each camera and it instantly saves that camera to your system. Amazing system and simple. The tiny speakers have loud clear sound and two way communication with these is like having a walkie. You can save to the cloud for a limited time then , here it comes, you have to pay a fee er camera to save after trial period. I'm not going to do that.

I\\'ll consider this camera system a starter set. I am pleased with it for the price range. The setup is super easy, those that complained about that I can not figure out why, it is REALLY easy using the mobile app. I\\'ll go out on a limb and say if you buy an outdoor version like me, your pretty much going to need a WiFi extender. My cameras are spread over 120 ft. In my opinion, the hardest part is getting the cameras spot picked out and mounted (usually requiring a ladder) so it works as intended. A major point of that last statement is that you may have to go back and tweak a cameras position just slightly. You probably won\\'t get it just right the first time out. You will probably spend the first two weeks playing with camera position, walking around in front of it to activate it, Privacy zones to block unwanted constant pick ups (traffic), and other features to get the camera to work well. I had one that was a little flaky picking up the view I wanted, I moved it\\'s position literally a 1/8\" and it started working great---little tweaks like this may be needed. I recommend using the advanced setting on the privacy zones to really fine tune it. You may have to tweak the cameras position to better fit the grid layout on the zones. I have one camera that is really high up (16 feet), I am going to wire in a outlet and get a power adapter for the camera so I never have to worry about battery life. All the rest of my cameras can be reached with a smaller 6 foot step ladder. You must use Lithium only batteries (Energizer\\'s included). Battery life will based on your usage. If your going to be outside moving around the yard, disarm the system unless you just have to see yourself. You can do live views anytime and save the clips also...a nice feature...but again, usage and battery life. My friend has these setup at a lakeside camp 150 miles away and over a year and a half so far on the original batteries, his home system is also going on just over 1 year on it\\'s original batteries. I hope for similar results. Delete your clips to keep the storage space clear and clean. Overall, this system is good if you just want to keep an eye on things. If you have issues you need help identifying people, license plates, etc, this may not be for you, you may have to step up and pay for a better 4k system such as a Lorax wired system. The Good: Easy set up (you should buy a WiFi extender--I bought a TP Link unit) Lets you see your cameras any time, any where with the App. Included USB port for a thumb drive (highly recommended) so you don\\'t have to have a cloud subscription Works good as intended, if you follow some key points in the instructions. Cameras activate well if item is going across view (left to right). Day time views are pretty good, you won\\'t see license plates, its standard setting is 720DPI, the high 1080DPI setting is better, but you still wont see license plates---but it consumes more battery life. The Bad: Night vision is just so -so. Black and White, all you\\'ll see is if someone is there, not who it is. Night vision is slightly better if you turn up the IR, but at the cost of battery life. The talk back is not very loud at all. Most people can\\'t hear unless within 8 feet or less. I wish it had a panic alarm to scare off would be people. Object coming straight towards camera will not always activate it. I had to turn the sensitivity to a higher level on all cameras to get them to work what I felt was correct'}\n",

I have nine cameras installed. 6 on the outside and 3 on the inside. The inside cameras work flawlessly. The outside cameras have had some glitches but overall seem to be doing the job properly. The only concern I've got is a 1-3 second delay. My biggest concern is whether these six outside cameras can withstand the hot summer of 2021, where temperatures are in excess of 100° and above. Four of the six cameras will be under shade and not in direct sun and only two will be possibly exposed, although I might have to move them temporarily until summer is over which might compromise the location  of what it's intended for. I might have to purchase a couple of covers for these cameras to keep them cooler. My second biggest concern, is if the batteries can actually hold up to the two-year lifespan advertised. I will probably have to come back after summer time is over and give a more detailed review of the product and the overall functionality. One feature I would love to see if possible, is to be able to go from one camera to another without having to wait for one camera to stop the 'live view'. It would be nice to see all cameras on one screen if that could be possible, so you could see everything in real time all at once...\"}\n",

The storage is confusing, if you purchased it during this time you only have free storage until this time, then you have to spend $10/month for them to keep the storage of this, or $100/year, if you buy more than one, pretty much. I bought silicon covers for them, which fit perfectly, I also purchased siding clips to put on the mount so I can put it on my house, haven't put it on the house yet. Here's one problem, I can not for the life of me push in the mount piece to the camera, it is so hard and I don't want to break it, I have been trying for an hour and have gotten two of the three done, it shouldn't be this hard, however I guess I should appreciate the fact that it's hard to put in, because then it would be hard for it to come off. I watched a guy on youtube, (LifeHackster) that put this camera to the test, you really can't see clearly after 15 feet with the night vision, in order to see well you will have to keep your outside lights on the entire night and turn the night vision off. Also the lag from live view to you seeing it on your phone is about 3 seconds and the time you see it, it's delayed. The app, you have to click the camera box in order to see it in live view, you can't just open your app and see all three of the cameras in live view, THAT'S HORRIBLE!! I should be able to click the app and see it live, Ring does it and so does the cloud cam that I have that is made by amazon, open the app and it's there, hopefully the app developers change that.

Motion works good and the feature to block out areas you don't want to cause motion work great and is easy. The 2 year battery use is an outstanding feature if this really works.

To keep it short, the Blink Outdoor camera is probably the most valuable and versatile security camera out on the market now, the price point is reasonable given some of our cameras that has been used for 3 years are still running smoothly.  Easy to install (idiot proof), and wireless option gives a lot of flexibility on camera placement. *The camera is small light weight, sleek looking, and not conspicuous (w/o mount).  The construct of the mount provided in the box is okay (anyone walk by can snatch the camera off from the mount), but for those who don\\'t like drilling holes on the wall: this camera can easily be velcro strapped on other place (i.e. cabinet door handle, railing, eaves) given this camera is light weight; the square shape also makes it easy to be mounted \"creatively\".  Just make sure to mount it high enough to avoid people from stealing it. *Image/audio quality: okay,  good enough to capture good video with recognizable sound. *Motion sensor: Robust, not too sensitive but good enough when someone walk by the camera under the default setting \"5\".  We have other camera system before and they were way too sensitive that even moving grasses or clouds would trigger the camera.  Note that the motion sensor sensitivity diminishes dramatically if placed behind a window. *Night vision: it is rated 4/10 for night vision.  When there is absolutely NO light, the video are quite blurry, just like the security camera footage back in the 80s/90s with higher resolution.  The motion sensor is sensitive under night vision, but the image capture is not as well as other major camera security brands. *IR: It is also \"okay\" and not robust.  without the night vision turned on, the IR wouldn\\'t work.  The video would be an empty black screen. Wifi: Excellent, we rarely (or never) have camera go offline unless there\\'s internet issues.  The reception is exeptionally well even it is placed far away from the hub. *battery life: ROBUST!  We probably only have to change the battery every year or so.  The app would notify user when battery is low. When comparing head to head with other brands (i.e. NightOwl, which is far more sensitive and generate super high quality video, clear audio and excellent low-light performance/videos): ALTHOUGH Blink is consider a mediocre product, it is more consumer and user friendly (self-installation, WAY MORE affordable).  The motion sensor sensitivity, video and audio quality are all at par for a basic security camera.  At the end of the day, the footage is not meant to make a movie at a theater, hence the specification on the Blink is sufficient enough for personal uses.'}\n",

They arrived quickly. Installation is relatively easy albeit sparsely documented by Blink. Down load the free Blink app for your phone, name your system (and components, like \"front door\"), plug in the control module (stays indoors plugged into the wall, interfaces with your WiFi), put in the batteries for the camera, scan the QR code to register and recognize the camera (note here that this is inside the back of the camera where the batteries are located, so you have to scan the code BEFORE you close up the case or you will have to disassemble it again to do the scan -- Blink doesn\\'t tell you this), and go mount the camera. I was done in about 40 minutes with two cameras. The pictures are reasonably clear, even at night (you can set the sensitivity for better night time video). Mounting the camera is intuitive, sort of -- it took a bit to determine that I had to remove a plug in the back and then press HARD to get the camera onto the mount. The software is easy to use after noodling around with it a bit. You can get a live feed, if desired, and take still pictures. The two-way microphone works very well and is loud and clear. The motion detection is decent, but is triggered by motion across the camera as opposed to towards or directly away from the camera. You can set how long you wish each event to record (e.g. 5 seconds, 10 seconds, etc.). It\\'s not particularly clear how you can store your videos longer term, it appears that you have to pay $3/month to use Amazon\\'s cloud service. Each motion-triggered event sends me a discrete video clip that I can view on my phone. There is a delay of tens of seconds to receive the video clip in some cases so it may not provide me with the opportunity to converse with someone (like a delivery person) at my front door before they are gone. On balance, the system works well with sharp pictures. I don\\'t expect to be able to read license plates on my street as the resolution isn\\'t THAT good (40 to 50 feet away from my cameras). I had to reduce the sensitivity on my garage mount as every time a car drove past it recorded the event initially. Now, it just triggers for people jogging by or walking their dogs on the sidewalk in front but not from random drive bys. For a basic system this is perfectly adequate and very reasonably priced. We will see what the battery life is like (since both cameras are outdoors, and it\\'s winter now, I\\'m doubtful that the two AA batteries provided (Everready) will last the claimed two years, but we\\'ll find out).'}\n",

Get help from the BLINK site or internet if necessary.  Once you've setup and installed one camera, the additional cameras get easier to add. There are more than enough settings in the app to finely adjust the system to your needs.  Having installed the system only four months ago, I cannot attest to battery longevity, but you can extend battery life with setting adjustments.  Also, order a few BLINK security signs and place in strategic places.  At the very least, signs and camera system acts as a good deterrent.\"}\n",

To save battery the cameras are consistently in a sleep mode, and wake up, record, and notifies you whenever there is motion detected. The time it takes to wake up to record when motion is detected takes a long time, and starts recording by the time the subject detected is already walking out of the cameras field of view. Night vision is also sub-par. You can still see that there is a figure walking in front of the camera, however you will never be able to identify anyone in the case of providing law enforcement with any footage of the perp that broke into your home. There\\'s a youtuber that has found a solution to this, and it works well if you pair it with a spotlight system, that way your camera doesn\\'t utilize IR for the night vision. But that\\'s just extra money needing to be spent to make your camera \"work\" well. It works better as a notification system rather than a security monitoring system. Also the fact that you must pay a subscription in order save any recordings and even utilize the local storage feature is terrible. Definitely defeats the purpose of having a local storage USB port. If you\\'re looking for a camera monitoring system for your property, you\\'re better off spending a little bit more money on a different brand that doesn\\'t require a subscription, can provide better night vision quality, and has a better timed notification system.'}\n",

It doesn't even have the basic functionality of adding additional users.  As I searched through the forum, I saw that users have been asking for this for 3 years.  The only recommendation for adding a user is to share, that's right, SHARE your email and password to others so they can use your FULL credentials in the app.  I have a roommate and I do not want to share my credentials and give full permission to modify my account just to allow permission to view the cameras.  My smart garage door, front and side door locks, and many other security camera systems have this basic functionality. It is a very basic smart system functionality that should have been included when the system was released. It's hard to believe that Amazon's Blink system does not have it. Aside from that, the cameras seem to work well so far.  I just got them set up, so do not have a lot of experience with them.  I just could not wait to share my disappointment with the lack of multiple user capabilities.  Set up was quick and easy, even without a lot of instruction.  You simply download the app, add the sync module, then begin adding cameras. I installed batteries, added each camera to my system and named and labeled each one at a time, so that I easily knew which was which.  The picture seems good enough to see at a pretty far distance and the 2 way audio works well.  The load time for seeing the live view is about a second or 2 when on WiFi.  I have not tried it using cellular data yet.  I also have not yet tried the motion detection, so I will be updating this review in the coming weeks.  Trouble with motion detection is the main reason I stopped using my Amcrest system, so I am hoping the Blink works better. Until the multiple user functionality is added, I cannot give this security camera system anything higher than 3 stars, as the lack of this is hardly secure.  I realize that Amazon has been busy in 2020, but there is no excuse for releasing a smart security camera system without basic smart functions that have been demanded by customers for 3 years.\"}\n",

They have also caught their bird and cat visitors, so their motion detection is quite good.

            "{'review_date': 'February 21, 2021', 'handle': 'WayG', 'rating': '3.0', 'helpfulness_rating': '', 'review': \"The GOOD: Bought these because they are wireless, battery operated, large range of outdoor ambient temperature and 1080 video.  Battery life is still unknown because I haven’t had them that long. All features above seem to work fine. it's 10F outside right now and they are still taking pictures. Picture quality is very good, can even zoom in once you get images on your PC. Cannot zoom in the app. The OKAY: The motion detection seems to have a very narrow range within the image view. Even on the highest sensitivity setting the cameras don't trigger until motion is more toward center of view. So almost all motion detected video capture you just see objects moving out of view instead of coming into view. The IR works well if there is absolute darkness in view of the camera.  If there is a street light or neighbors lights or any source of light in view of camera at night, IR is very poor, nearly a black image with white spots from the other light sources. There is a photo capture option where a single picture is taken once an hour. Each day you get a string of these images. I like that, but they are not time stamped, nothing in blink is time stamped except the video/picture file. So this nice feature cannot be used for anything unless you can guess what time the images were taken. They don’t start at midnight and run to midnight, they appear to be random start and stop based on the last motion detected. So sometimes you get a string of 2 hours, others 6 hours, sometimes 24 hours if no motion was detect that day. The UGLY: Audio. If you were going to buy these for the audio, don’t, it sucks. I have 6 of these cameras now and even though I bought them for above reasons, I check the audio on each. All the same, just crackles and pops and hisses. In a long sentence you might pick out one word. The noise may startle someone, but you will not be able to communicate with or have a conversation with them as shown in Blink advertisements.\"}\n",

I can't purchase and install some of the higher end wired systems since I'm only renting. I'm overall satisfied with the daytime image quality and the features/functionality of the app. If you purchase this for home monitoring and peace of mind it is very capable. However, in terms of real security this system has some drawbacks. First, even with the strongest wi-fi signal and extremely high speed internet, the time from motion detection/recording to notification on my phone was upwards of 15 seconds. This would give any serious burglar time to kick your door in and be inside your home before the camera has a chance to start recording. On a default sensitivity of 5 the cameras did not register me pulling into my driveway with my Ford F150 Supercab even though the entire driveway is within the motion detection zone of two separate cameras. I set the cameras to a 7 level sensitivity to see where they would trigger walking up from the edge of my driveway and neither camera detected motion until I was outside of the camera view. I was able to slowly walk from the edge of my driveway and walk into my house through the front door and the only thing the camera recorded was the door closing after I entered the house. I still have to play around with the sensitivity but the risk is that increasing the sensitivity further is going to increase the number of false positives. The infrared is ok but struggles providing image clarity beyond about 10-12 feet. If there are areas of high contrast in the camera's field of view, such as a white pillar, the camera will adjust to that and everything behind it will be nearly pitch black. There's also no option to adjust the point of focus for the camera/infrared so this makes placing multiple cameras on the same area necessary.\"}\n",

The biggest disappointment is that the cameras do not pick up motion for everything in view. Only up to about 20 feet (My personal testing of actual videos captures with my system). So if you want this as a door camera, this will probably suit your needs, However if your looking for security movement within your property, not so much. Picture is great in daylight with no shade, but shaded areas and night vision is something less than desirable. I hope this will help you with what needs you are wanting for your home. P.S.

However I chose to hook some of the cameras to a power source.  The App does not indicate that the camera is now connected to continuous power - in fact even if you remove the batteries and disconnect the power cord, the app tells you that the batteries are \"OK\". Tried closing the app and rebooting my phone and it still said batteries \"OK\" even though no power source was connected at all--- seems hard to trust Update: After this review I heard immediately from both their management and tech support.  Tech support indicated that it would take about an hour for the cameras to update and display more accurate information.  Management felt that providing new electrical plugs would somehow make a difference?? . . it was a nice gesture but no change noticed. Be aware of the limitations of the motion sensors that activate the cameras.  I have an alley on one side of my house and there is evidence that some may be up to no good, so I wanted surveillance.  To capture a good view I mounted the camera on my chimney facing down and it captures a long stretch of the ally, but the camera is too far away and so the motion sensor does not activate the camera when someone is in the alley.  Result? No surveillance!  If this camera could be linked with another camera I have that catches a much smaller portion of the alley, but does activate when someone walks by it would be most helpful!! 2 Suggestions: Make it possible to link cameras so that the motion sensor of one camera activates both cameras (or however many cameras one wants). Next in the Blink app when reviewing the clips a \"Select All\" check box that selects all the clips would sure be helpful rather than having to tap each one when you have many clips stored and they all can be deleted and storage space regained.'}\n",

I like that it alerts my phone and my Alexa device whenever motion is detected and that I can change the sensitivity level. I didn't give these 5 stars because (1) sometimes the WiFi signal is lost and they're more or less useless for those few minutes (it doesn't happen very often either), (2) there's wait time in between switching through camera live view, (3) I wish I could see all of my cameras at once instead of having to toggle between them in my app, (5) I wish the live view came up on my Alexa device instead of just saying motion was detected, forcing me to give the command to show the camera. Overall, I think the outdoor blink cameras are worth the money. They do what they say they do, and they're easy to install anywhere, the batteries last a long time, even with constant motion detection and high quality video. They even have two way audio, so they're also a great alternative for a video doorbell. I also have blink mini's that I use from inside, facing outside, as part of my perimeter. They're less expensive and more reliable, in my opinion, but they can be difficult to use for outdoor monitoring because of window glare (they do, however, work great in a garage). If you're trying to decide on the outdoor or indoor cameras for outdoor monitoring, just go with the outdoor cameras and save yourself the hassle. The outdoor cameras are a good choice for anyone who wants a camera/motion detector installed easily and quickly, and doesn't want to deal with more complex, wired systems.\"}\n",

I did not want to pay almost twice as much for ring cameras to have the real time live view, and then pay extra to have spare rechargeable batteries for when the ones in the cameras died. Also having local storage was a HUGE upside, no fees to pay yearly.  If you want a system that alerts you when there is motion and something you can peek at every now and then to see what is going on and have local storage then this is a good system.  if you want something that records every second of the day then that you monitor constantly then this is not the system for you.  There is always a negative to every system.  Do your research and choose what is best for you.  the system has been installed for about a week now. I will update when and if needed. Pros: Price Easy setup and configuring. Local storage (no need for subscription storage) I have a 64gb thumb drive in mine. You can run power to them if you don\\'t want to depend on batteries.  Only downside is once you open the rubber gasket to do this they are not weather proof, but they make cases that will fix that issue. Cons: Motion detection could use some refining.

If your phone can't tether, it's likely you won't be able to get it to connect to your WiFi (2021/02/02). 2. The mounting hardware is fairly ill-conceived and can cause hours of frustration. The engineering team that approved it really should be fired. It's much easier if you use the right angle bracket, but that assumes you're mounting in a situation where you need a right angle. Also as others have pointed out, the brackets offer no physical security. 3. The software controls are generally insufficient. Everything is dumbed down too much--it needs an Advanced Options section. I want my cameras to back up to local storage ASAP, but instead I'm only given the option to do it once-per-day. There are also no firm controls for preventing your video from being sent to the cloud--it's entirely unclear where my video is going, which is a severe security problem. 4.

So difficult in fact, that I made the (very bad) decision to see if a rubber mallet would apply the necessary pressure to snap the camera into place.

We have 4 indoor cameras and 5 outdoor cameras. All of the cameras are with in a 30ft radius of the sync module , Echo show 5 and the Fire TV. The only thing we do not like about the camera system so far is that when you ask the fire TV or Echo show to display a camera it will think for 3 minutes and tell you the camera is not responding. But when you open the phone app it has recorded the video you asked for . We have had them for 5 months with lots of recording and battery is still in ok status. Video is good enough to tell if it is a UPS driver or FEDEX driver by the shirt embroidering. If anyone know how to get it working with Fire TV stick I will up my start rating.'}\n",

Owned 5 of the XT2 and they were as buggy as can be.  Blink support at first was informative and tried to help.  But in time when they realized they could not fixt the problems with the XT2, they stopped giving updates and they stopped communicating with me.  I have waited over a year now to get my XT2 to work consistently (and I use the term lightly cause I would be thrilled with a 80 percent success rate, but it is now down to 20 percent connection rate) with my Show 8 and Show 5.  All I see now is waiting for Blink.  I hear audio but no video.  It is a documented problem that they have admitted to me--this was at a time when they still communicated and were informative.  They actually talked me into keeping my XT2s because they were aware of the problem and getting it sorted out.  Well a year later and nothing has been done about it.  I have just resorted to these things being system I check on my phone and nothing else.  CANNOT use these things with my Echo Shows 5 and 8's.  And weird thing is they sold them as a set on Prime day last year cause they worked hand in hand like a hand and glove.  Obviously these work great for some people as people claim they use them everyday with their Show devices.  But then there are those that have the exact same problems as me.  Its documented.  I am assuming there there is a batch of buggy hardware that got produced, and they now realize it and realize that they can do nothing with these buggy pieces of hardware, so the quiet stand on the communication side.  Should have listened to my wife who said within the return period....get rid of these things. So long story short....I tried these new ones out and junk.  Same buggy hardware and software.  Didn't even try to contact support cause it would be nothing but lies and false promises and I dont need this junk in my life.  To conclude this long story that I shortened:):).....If you have problems with them the day you get them, you will have problems with them from a year from now.  You will have to learn to live with it.  Stay away from them if you are having problems now.\"}\n",

However, they still want you to pay for cloud service, otherwise, even with local storage capability you cannot record, you can only view live. This will be the reason to stay with Arlo cameras instead of switching to Blink. If you are purchasing equipment to store locally, you should not have to still pay for a cloud subscription, what is the point of paying more for local storage then? A total rip off. Update 10/30/20 Blink customer service actually read my review and reached out right away.  They clarified that there is some miscommunication on the issue of recording and storage with local USB, I was informed I do not need the cloud subscription in order to have those capabilities with the Sync Module and USB. I changed the rating to 4 stars because other than that I am very happy with product so far. They even offered compensation for the lack of clarity. Did not give 5 stars due to the very flimsy mounting system, crossing fingers the wind in our area which we often get (gusts up to 50 MPH) doesn't cause them to fall.

(blink support) reached out to me and offered to replace the camera I'm having problems with.  I appreciate their attempts to correct the problem and reaching out to me.  As originally mentioned, I do like these cameras, they are very easy to use and I love being able to automatically arm them with the IFTTT app whenever I leave home.  I'm upgrading this to 4 stars, I may adjust this in the future. ORIGINAL: I like these cameras, they are easy to setup, the PIR motion reduces if not nearly eliminates false alarms, and the app is very simple.  So, why the one star review?  Tech support is horrible and a product is only as good as the company behind it. After having these up and running for a while I noticed my garage camera would just record random video, meaning no motion triggered it. Motion events worked fine, but out of nowhere it would record even when there was no motion.  This doesn't happen often, but I did happen enough so I wanted to find out why. On or about Friday (Jan 22nd, 2021) I sent a message through the blink app to customer support explaining the situation.  I was very detailed and very clear about what was happening, along with all the settings I checked. Saturday, receive the standard reply, check the FAQ, download latest app, etc, etc...  Later that day I get another message asking me to enable customer support access, that was done.  I was unsure how much access customer support would have so I disconnected my interior cameras, these are not the camera I was having problems with and not set to record.  I write back and tell them access is granted.  Then, another thanks for contacting Blink and check the FAQ email, etc, etc..  Shortly after the last email I get another email wanting to verify the garage is recording motion even though no motion is detected. Sunday, I confirm the last message and explain the garage camera is recording approximately 30 seconds of video randomly.  This is getting frustrating, I'm basically telling them the same thing I clearly explained in the first email.  Later this evening, yet again someone else from Blink asking me for the email associated with this account.  Ok, at this point my fuse is starting to get short, shouldn't they already have this info since the initial support request was through the app.  There is approximately 12 hours between responses, at this pace and them asking questions that I've already answered in previous emails, it's going to take a week to get anything resolved. Out of frustration, I just told them lets call it quits if they are not able to fix the problem.  They responded with that's my right and they will mark the ticket closed. Maybe I should have been a little more patient, but this really should have been resolved with one or two emails, not additional emails asking me to confirm what I already explained, then later emails asking me for account information.  It really felt like I was talking to someone new on every email and having to repeat information to them.  A product is only as good as the company behind it, and because of the tech support, I'm giving this one star.  I really want to like this product, but it's hard when you feel like you're talking to a call center half way across the world.\"}\n",

I upped the review from 3 to 4 stars. Customer service reached out to us and helped us out.  They\\'re so helpful it\\'s almost annoying :) We have recommended this system to neighbors and friends who are also in the market due to a recent rash of burglaries in the area.  It is exactly what we are looking for. Thoughts from a month of use - There is a 5 second delay for recording so movement can cause the camera to activate but the cause could be out of frame before recording starts.  We have moved cameras, and thanks to customer service, have added a third camera to help cover our large farmyard.  This has helped this issue.  There is a feature that if the movement is no longer detected the recording stops earlier. There is a small delay in the talkback feature but this is not an issue for us as we don\\'t expect to have conversations using it other than to say \"Get the hell off my property\" :) We LOVE the ability to store videos to a USB vs the cloud. The APP is awesome and VERY user friendly.  We really enjoy it. Especially the auto scheduling feature. No worry about forgetting to arm the system. We live on a farm with a large yard.  The cameras have a great reach to the module. We have one camera mounted about 20\\' up on the side of a grain bin, easily 60+ feet from the house where the module is. My husband built a little shed for the camera to help protect it from snow accumulation. Night vision is decent.  The spider that kept building a web in front of the camera did not set off the motion detection.  We have since moved the camera so the spider doesn\\'t block it any more. FIRST REVIEW: 2 days in. Happy with video quality. Watching live is a little laggy but only by a few seconds, however we live in BFE so our internet is a whopping 8mbps so that might have something to do with that. The picture is a little wider than expected but we were able to find placements to meet our needs. We have elected to go the USB route and wait to sign up for the cloud until we know if we need it or not. Overall, two days in, we are content with the purchase. We are also first time security camera users and cannot offer comparison reviews. The App is very user friendly. Will update in the future if our first impressions change in either direction.'}\n",

I have 5 of these cameras because I have a house with vaulted ceilings. CONs: they can’t be watched live if they are in the process of recording. I have a few of them that are always being triggered since they are mounted on the front of my house. What good does it do me to watch a video of someone breaking into my house if I get the alert and video AFTER it’s happened? The motion detection is hit or miss. Some days the cameras are set off so much I have to turn the sensitivity down. Other days, I get no alerts at all and that’s from the same cameras that face the street. You can set motion detection zones, which don’t work at all. I’ve excluded the street and side walk from my camera’s “view” and I still get alerts of motion in those zones. That’s annoying since kids play out there all the time. Which leads to my next point, those camera eat batteries. I’ve replaced batteries in those front facing cameras and literally within days I get a low battery warning. They lose connection to the wireless network. I’m in IT. I have a ubiquiti setup in my house. My access point gives off a very strong signal. These stupid cameras need to be reset every few weeks or they just don’t work.

Cameras make an audible click sound so it does scare animals walking by and people can see the light and hear the click.  My wi-fi is good but it’s slow in catching motion.  Sometimes the mail carrier has already delivered the mail before the camera catches up.  Sometimes I will see a cat or raccoon and other times it detects nothing.  Other times it’s so sensitive that a bush blowing a bit will set it off.  Or rain might set it off. The motion detection will not work at all through a window.  If I hear a noise outside and try to monitor, I will see it spin on screen before I get a video.  Or it might say it failed. If someone entered my house, the unit facing the door would both make an audible click and the light would go on.  Then the criminal would simply remove the camera, making it useless.  I consider this a huge design flaw. As far as the mounting brackets go, you could hit them with something like a basketball or stick and knock them off their mount.  I bought some of the exterior boxes and have a gutter mount.  Gutter mount is sturdy but you could still knock it off with a stick.  So, if you have a rake, you could just go around and knock them off. When I was looking at them, I saw the guy on night vision who said he got to 35’ and it went off.  I have not found this to be the case.  Either my wi-fi is slow or it’s about 18’ out when the motion is detected.  I tried different settings.  And I measured.  Sometimes it would “see” me at 18’ and most other times it didn’t detect motion for about 15’.  My camera is 12’ from my door.  I will sometimes almost miss my mail carrier completely.  So I might just catch the top of her head as she is leaving, but not actually seeing her deliver mail. Moving the main unit hasn’t changed that issue. Camera is also set to continue recording if there is still motion.  This does not happen.  Most of the time, camera will stop then start again, showing you more videos but definitely missing motion. I do think it’s cool that even on interior looking outside, it will take a picture every hour and you can get to see good sunrises.  It’s like a series of time-lapsed photography.

Now regarding the cameras themselves, here are a few pros and cons that gets past the marketing speak that they try to have for the cameras - The default recording setting is only 5 second clips with a 10 second re-arm time so the 2 year battery life claim is ONLY if you use these default settings, if you choose to change the settings to the max clip length which is 1 minute clips with 10 second re-arm time and you put the cameras in a high traffic area you will have to change the batteries every 3-4 days and you will get a message saying \"warning: high usage\" on your blink app for the camera. - The cameras get triggered when there are shadows from tree branches moving on the driveway, when vehicles pass by the streets, when lights reflect against windows, and other shadows/reflections also trigger the cameras, there is no way to avoid this because the cameras cant tell the difference between actual people and shadows/reflections. - The maximum clip length is 1 minute with a minimum re-arm time of 10 seconds, there is no way to increase the clip length to more than 1 minute or to decrease the re-arm time to less than 10 seconds even if you hook up aftermarket solar panels to your blink system so that you wont have to constantly switch out batteries. I setup some cameras to watch my vehicle in the front driveway because I had some problems with previous roommates before I got cameras and people learn to wait until the cameras turn off when they dont want to be recorded because they know that the re-arm time is pretty long (10 seconds) so they wait until the cameras turn off to do what they want to do before they turn back on. - There is no way to add internal storage or network attached storage to your blink system. - Maximum clip quality is 1080p, there are 3 quality settings (480p, 720p, 1080p) and it seems to default at 720p. Its still hard to read pictures on boxes that people are carrying or see pictures on boxes that people are carrying when they pass by the cameras really quickly even in 1080p quality. I dont know why Amazon decided to add a yearly subscription fee for their previously free cloud storage but it sure is a way to kill off a product when there are dozens of viable competitors out there that record in 2k or 4k and let you use internal storage.'}\n",

Initially the lack of monthly subscription and the ease of install (due to batteries which last a year) was a big draw. The first item is no longer valid as only older accounts are grandfathered into the \"free\" plan. The second is basically a lie. The batteries are good for an hour or so of actual recording time. Which means they last a year if you have the camera in a place where it triggers once a week for 10 seconds. If you put it on your front door and enter/leave once a day it will last a month or two. So the camera quality is pretty poor, its says 1080p, but you won\\'t be able to make out name tags of people standing at your door, or license plates in your driveway.

Its not unusual to only capture the delivery guy leaving the driveway and completely miss his/her walk to the door/etc. Plus someone at amazon is being encouraged to force people to use SMS as a 2nd factor, despite SMS probably decreasing the security of the system (no one who knows anything recommends sms for security/etc).

My biggest complaints are the delay of notification(s) & sensitivity of motion detection. So first complaint: notifications. Comparing blink to my ring & wyze cames, it seems like it takes an eternity to receive motion notification. Where the other 2 systems notify within seconds, it easily takes a couple of minutes to get anything. For example, I set my recording schedule with blink to revolve around a normal day of work since my schedule is pretty consistent. If I leave early to go to or from work, it’ll trip the recording. When leaving, I won’t get a motion notification until I’m already well outside of my neighborhood or when arriving, after I have my shoes off and am petting the dog that there’s motion in my driveway. Second issue I see as a double-edged sword: motion detection. It’s great at capturing motion but it takes a whooooole lot of fine tuning to get it to where you need it to be. It took a total of 6 mos of messing with the motion sensitivity & motion zones to finally get it where the tree in my front yard wouldn’t set it off on a windy days. By then, I had to replace the battery already in one but the other however is still going strong 15 mos later. All in all, it is a nice system that I would still recommend to family & friends, with the aforementioned caveats. However, those caveats are a deal breaker for me and am choosing a different route with my cameras.'}\n",

So, you have to choose between a low/weather exposed/possibly reachable to steal camera, or having the image flooded with static light from the night vision.  Even when set lower, the night vision is way worse than my ring and even my version 2 wyze cams. I will be switching to wyze cam v3 in mid november when these release. These also have absolutely horrible sound.  If you face a road or any kind of noise, the audio is impossible to make out. Also, at daytime with my camera mounted 11\\' feet from the entry door, unfamiliar faces are blurry and undetailed. At night time with night vision. its genuinely hard to tell a male from a female face, let alone anything distinguishable. I have 6 of these cameras and wasted my money. Also, set to record 30 second videos at high quality, my batteries lasted less than three days. I now have them set to 15 seconds of video, to stop when motion stops, and they only lasted 7 days. So, if you\\'re looking for legit security, and not ocassional recording, you\\'ll need to get their brand specific cord with the water proofing and plug them in. Also, within the app, when watching one video, it will jump random to other unwatched videos... so, if you view one alert, then three alearts later, start watching clips, it may jump back 5 or 7 or 83 alerts, seemingly at random.

I'm sorry my parents wasted the money on this garbage and wish I could return them without hurt feelings. So where to begin. 1) Instillation. How in the world are you supposed to install these? The mounts they come with fit some rinky size 6 screws. Which is perfectly fine if you have wood trim. I have brick and a few feet of plastic siding above my garage. So you have to purchase more products that don't come in the same quantity as the cameras. 2) Use. Wait for it....wait for it....wait for it....there it is! So. Much. Delay. I'm not sure why but these are far worse than the last generation. At my folks house it's a few seconds delay. You get the notification on your phone about the time someone is at your door. Not entirely useless but not exactly useful. These bad boys? Oh my. If something was triggered the camera when you started reading this review you might (MIGHT) just be getting the notification. Wifi shouldn't be a factor as I have enough for 3 people to game and one to stream all at the same time and the proximity to the router is quite literally just one wall away. 3) Motion. If something moves across the camera it's reasonable at picking it up but if it's walking towards it? Ha good luck getting the darn thing to go off. I've had package deliveries at my door that don't set it off. 4) Save your money and just don't.\"}\n",

The motion detection, night vision and wifi signal are good.  however, if you have a large area to cover or in an area with lots of solid obstructions (i.e. cement, brick, steel, or aluminum), you may want to improve the wifi by upgrading it to a  meshed network, e.g. Google nest or google wifi route 2020.  For the motion detection aspect, it allows you to set areas to ignore and adjust sensitivity.  However, you may have to put in some time adjusting these settings to find a balance of coverage area, frequency of triggers, and amount of recordings/alerts.  Remember, the more you record the more battery and drive space you will use. I wish the app allowed more granular controls over each camera tied to a particular sync module.  But until they do, the blink still gets as a solid 4 stars from us! One last note, having more than one blink sync module may assist in your fine tuning your security system and coverage area.  If you fall in the category of needing a mesh network to extend your wifi coverage, you will most likely benefit from having more than one sync module as well.  This is because the cameras must also communicate with the sync module via Low Frequency Radio (LFR); this is separate from your home wifi.'}\n",

First, no matter how hard I have tried to block out certain areas in the frame so the dog walkers, etc., won\\'t set it off, it still is triggered by these unimportant events. The \"masking\" system does not work, and the unnecessary triggers drain the battery. Second, it often does not trigger, or triggers too late, for events that are right in the middle of the field of view. Sometimes this is because the \"recovery time\" from a previous trigger seems to be long no matter what you do in the settings. Third, these cameras are quite insecurely attached. You can just pop them on and off the mount. I supposed that is so changing the batteries is easy, but anybody who is bold enough to grab it can just walk off with your investment.

Imagine you bought a car back when they didn't have tracking devices, and now they want to track you, so they tell you you must submit to being tracked, and when you refuse, they take the tires off a vehicle YOU ALREADY PURCHASED AND USED, and tell you you can't drive it again until you allow them to track you. That's what Blink and Amazon are doing.\"}\n",

Download the app, record the serial numbers which are on the inside back of the camera, you can take a picture to enlarge the number if you are blind like me.  First add the sync module to the app, it will update the firmware, then add the camera to the app, again updates the firmware.  Take the default names for the cameras, which happen to the be serial numbers.  Add the blink skill to alexa, then you can rename the camera in the alexa skill.  I named mine backyard cam. Plus - Sends live view to echo show with command alexa show backyard cam. Sends live view to your TV if you have a fire stick with alexa voice remote Easy setup of schedule, a couple clicks and you have an off and on time for motion. Sync module allows limited local storage of clips – seems to do a backup once a day. You can add 10 cameras to one sync module – I have indoor, outdoor and a mini all hooked up. Motion detection via zones - better control of where to look for motion. Ability to turn off camera led recording and status lights – so no one knows it is on. Minus – No current plan for local storage - There isn't currently a way to turn off cloud storage in the app, so this is a work in progress.  Company says, local storage includes a backup once a day of your cloud,  live view, and notifications if it catches movement.  Without cloud you can view clips via USB drive on your PC.  The box says  'Local storage is record and store video clips to the blink sync module 2 in your home and view them in your Blink app from anywhere, no monthly fees required'.  Hopefully the company and the box gets in sync with what will really occur. Batteries seem like a good idea until you have to change them.  Make sure your cameras are accessible, indoor cam, no big deal, outdoor cam, a big deal if you have to get on a ladder in the middle of winter to change a battery so choose your install locations carefully. Night vision can't be used if looking out a window due to reflection.  So I turn it off, which mean you need a street light to see anything. Cloud has a monthly fee. Overall - Not a bad first attempt.  I like the build quality of the cameras, but not too keen on the mysterious local storage.  There are other cameras which have working local storage in the form of an SD card on the camera in which you can see all the triggered events right in the app with a scrolling timeline, which is great for an indoor cam, instead of having to unplug the USB drive and move it to a PC. I didn't really see a difference in specs from the outdoor vs indoor, I guess the outdoor is water resistant, you have to determine if that is worth the difference in price.  I didn't think so but I am currently using both through a window, as I can't find a place outside that is accessible without a ladder to get a full view of the backyard.  The outdoor package came with a sync module, but since I have the indoor package as well, I guess I have an extra sync module for the future. You might hold off purchasing until January to see what local storage becomes.  But then again, you have until Jan 31 to return the item, if it doesn't meet your expectations..\"}\n",

Customer service from Amazon has been outstanding.  They are actually sending me another unit without my even asking.  As for the cameras, they are working now.  I had to put the sync module literally touching the router to have these work.  Seems that the sync module is the weak point in the system, but it is working.  We do have congested area here in the 2.4GHz band so it will be more difficult if you\\'re in a similar environment such as apartments with lots of signals. These are Wi-Fi so it\\'s understandable that this type of environment would interfere with them operating properly.  I made sure to use nonoverlapping channels and used my Wi-Fi analyzer on my iPhone to measure signals where I would place the cameras.  My door camera is probably 15 feet drawing a straight line from router with a wood floor in between that the signal needs to pass through.  No other obstructions. If I put the sync module in between the router and the camera you would think this would be a great placement since the router would only be about 10 feet away with direct line of sight, and the sync module in-between .  Doesn\\'t work though.  I had to move the sync module back on to the table touching the router.  The cameras are all working now.  Live view is very slow and isn\\'t practically useable for any real time viewing.  It can take as long as 30 seconds sometimes to pull this up.  Shortest time is about 10 seconds.  The motion detection is good though and you will be alerted that something is there in real time.  You just won\\'t be able to see it right away. I paid approx. $45 a camera with the bundle from Costco: 4 outdoor and 1 indoor.  I don\\'t think I would pay anymore than $50 for a camera like this.  I \\'m glad I have them and they are useful but for true security you\\'ll probably need to purchase a wired system.  if you live in a single family home with no other WIFI interference from your neighbors you may get better performance.  Customer service at Amazon was great though and they\\'ll work with you. Updated, Updated review---I just got off the phone with Amazon customer support.  Five stars to customer support.  The lady was very attentive and walked me through everything I had already done.  The cameras all went offline, again,  is why I called.  We got the cameras all connected again, but this is really the same story as you can read from my reviews below.  I can get them working, but they don\\'t stay working.  At the very end customer support had me download an app \"RouteThis Helps\".  It analyzes your system and sends the data to Amazon.  My 2GHz analysis came up as 0.31 Mbps or something like that.  My own Wi-Fi analyzer pegged me at 54.00 MBs.  I just went outdoors and measured my wifi signal at the front door and then at my furthest camera.  Front door camera measured at 14.7Mbps.  Furthest camera was at 4.4Mbps.  Also the indoor Mini has worked flawlessly.  It\\'s the furthest away from the sync module and wifi access point, buried in the garage pointed at a dial on my furnace I need to keep track of.  This thing is buried so deep behind walls and obstructions not to mention behind a 180 gallon water heater that I was amazed it even worked.  But I have had no problems with live views or any connectivity at all with this camera.  It\\'s surpassed any expectation I ever could have for a wifi camera, and way better than my Samsung Smarthome which I replaced.  So I give 5 stars to the indoor mini camera. Unfortunately my outdoor cameras have not been of the same quality, even when plugged in to an AC source with a USB cable.  My closest outdoor camera is outside with an exterior  wood wall in between which is poor conduction for wifi I know, but it\\'s like about 7 feet away from the sync module drawing a straight line.  From the access point if you drew a straight line it\\'s about 15 ft away with a wall in between.  Three bars showing in the Blink App for connection and 3 bars for the sync module.  As stated earlier I measured 14.7Mbps at this camera, 4.4Mbps at my furthest camera.  So I don\\'t have a lot of confidence in the app Amazon asked me to download and measure my wifi with.  We have never had any connectivity issues with smart devices in the house or anything else for that matter.  Add to this that the mini-blink camera works great and it\\'s a miracle it works at all because of where I\\'ve placed it.  Our smart devices are 2 echoes, a google nest, some smart bulbs and smart light switches. So after getting off the phone with customer service the cameras are up and running, and fast, just like they always do when I go through this scenario.  But, I\\'ve been down this road before.  If the same pattern holds true sometime tomorrow they\\'ll all disconnect again and I\\'ll have to start this same process over again.  That\\'s how it\\'s been with these cameras.  Again, kudos to customer support.  Give the lady who helped me a raise if anyone from Amazon is reviewing this because she was very nice and did her best to help. I really want these cameras to work, because they have been helpful for the one day stints that they work. I really want them to work. But......we\\'ll see. Updated review-- I\\'m changing from one star to 3 stars.  You can read my original review below.  These cameras need 1.5v no more no less at a constant rate.  Cold will affect this even with the batteries recommended by Amazon, and even with new batteries installed.  I decided to give these one more try before returning to Costco.  I really want these to work because the price in the package deal I got at Costco is great compared to other options. Setting these up for the third time, the cameras were all recognized easily just as I had done the first time.  This tells me there are issues between the Blink servers and communicating with the device.  The cameras had all been disconnected for over 24 hours since I was going to return them.  I\\'ve also noted very long delays from the Blink servers in notifications, and I also have received video replays that I\\'ve deleted but they show up again the next day as a notification.  So, don\\'t expect reliable real time service from the Blink servers.  The one camera that went offline this morning came back on it\\'s own after the temperature went up to 24f. So my final review on these is 3 stars due to the blink servers, the fact these cameras are extremely temperamental about their power supply, and cold does affect them.  Note, I did test my batteries with a battery tester and they were full power.  Also, when trying to get the cameras recognized on the 2nd attempt it just didn\\'t happen, but wait 24 hours and it worked fine on the 3rd round of tries.  The cameras work alright for general use and being able to monitor something but not reliably in real time.  Don\\'t rely on these to provide any crucial security.  The live views are hit and miss and not reliable at all; I have 3 bars showing for wifi and sync module connections.  I\\'d estimate live view reliability  at 50% and even if it works it takes a long time to spin up and get any kind of live feed.  Right now its warmed up to 28f and 2 of the cameras won\\'t even take a live photo.  Trying it later on will probably work.  The live view video and photo is extremely spotty at best.  I\\'ve reduced IR sensitivity to low and all the other options to minimum that might draw more power but still the live view is very unreliable. The indoor camera that came with this package has performed great with no problems because it\\'s always plugged in to an AC outlet.  If you use one of the outdoor cameras plugged in to a constant power supply I\\'m wondering if they would would work better.  But, if I could provide a constant power supply from AC I wouldn\\'t be using these Blink cameras and instead a different more reliable system.  However, I can\\'t provide that constant power supply so that\\'s why I chose the wireless option.  I\\'m using them and they\\'re useful but don\\'t rely on them for any real time security issues.  Also the price point would be a deal breaker for me.  If I hadn\\'t got a package  at this price I don\\'t think I would invest in these.  I got the 4 outdoor cameras at roughly 45$ a piece in this deal.  I wouldn\\'t pay any more than that for the outdoor cameras. Original review -- I got these at Costco as part of a bundle.  Four outdoor cameras and one indoor for $209.  Great price.  I set them up with no problems outdoors as well as the indoor camera indoors.  The outdoors cameras worked for about a day, then they all went out at once.  I tried setting up again but it was really difficult to get the cameras recognized.  It wasn\\'t easy this time.  So I deleted the whole system and started over.  The sync hub connects pretty easily but the cameras are very reluctant to be recognized.  Eventually I got them all working again, for about a day.  After taking them in for the second time now I got one camera recognized out of the 4 outdoor ones after hours of trying all the remedies from the blink site.  Took the batteries out, powered cameras off of a usb cable, wait fail, rinse, repeat. Yes I restarted my router, more than once and tested my batteries in each camera. I\\'m taking these back to Costco tomorrow.  Even if they had worked for a year eventually I\\'d have to replace the batteries and presumably go through this hassle again.  To have all four cameras behave like this isn\\'t just getting a lemon out of the bunch.  I mean all four have this problem.  I definitely won\\'t be buying blink cameras again.'}\n",

It did not work as well as promised. 1) I have great wifi coverage around the house; so I thought it would be a no-brainer, but that is not good enough.  The cameras need to talk to the sync module on its own WiFi network not yours.  It claims to have 100' range, but that must be in cow pasture because in an ordinary wood-frame house, I can't get good signal connection to more than 2 of the 3 no matter where I put the sync unit.  The two furthest cameras are about 100' apart; so it should not be a problem, but it is.  In theory, I could fixe this by paying for another sync module, although I'd rather they fix it by using my network instead of theirs.  You should assume you'll have to buy extra modules unless your cameras are clustered. 2) a) One of the 3 cameras  has very poor IR.  It is bascially worthless at night, but the other two are fine.  I can pump up the IR intensity and it helps, but that will surely suck battery.  b) There are lots of warnings about battery life not being 2 years, if you actually use if for anything.  So I am not optimistic on that front. 3) There does not appear to be a PC version of the app.  I'd like to be able to see the cameras from my desktop, but they don't want that, I imagine, because they want you to buy an Echo Show--for which there is an app.  Integration with Alexa is a good thing, but I prefer to not be limited to that ecosphere. 4) You can put in USB storage into the sync module to record images, but you can't access it directly.  You have to replace the USB stick and put it in your own computer.  Given the sync module has to be connected to your wifi anyway, they should make the USB accessible over that.  Of course, that would compete with the service they want to sell you. 5) More of a suggestion: It sure would be nice if Blink, Ring and Amazon cameras could be integrated on the app side.  I have some of each. To me it feels like this product was engineered to force the user into spending more money with Amazon.  I don't mind doing this when it increased the value to me, but I do mind it when the product has been engineered to be hard to use any other way. If none of these shortcomings are relevant to you, it is a fine system, but for me it is 2 stars.\"}\n",

It’s a decent system that has non contractual usage, which is very awesome... I just find a couple of issues with the system performance. There are no options for notification updates or changes to the system and the only tone that it will play doesn’t not work all me up at night. Also, you can arm the system on a schedule, which is cool, but again system options are limited. I have cameras that surround my house but, my dogs are always setting off the backyard cams... which happens all day and night. You can’t just arm the front yard cameras for all day use while turning off the rear cameras so the dogs don’t set them off in the day time. This means if you’re armed and home, your phone will go off alllllllllll day, and basically be ineffective for monitoring. We have a pool so all day long I’m also going in and out the house and it just adds to the notifications. I hoped this unit would allow more function in settings but it’s just very basic. There are a couple neat Alexa add one, but I refuse to buy Alexa for several reasons and feel there is a ploy to have to buy Alexa when those features like voice announcements or lights turning on upon motion. I like the system for its purpose, but the function and personalization falls flat on its face and that’s the reason it’s not 5 stars. I’ve read posts and there is AMPLE feedback to Blink/Amazon to correct the notifications (again notification ringer is ineffective unless awake and CANNOT BE CHANGED) but isn’t fixed. I have iphone, heard android users have a little more function??? Yet another uncorrected design flaw. Also, the system crashes from WiFi for no identified reason and requires you to mess with the system. Doesn’t take long but had this a week and happened twice while I’m out and renders the system useless. Another issue is that there is a 10-15 second delay to speak live through the cameras, even with early detection on. Still helpful, but trying to talk to someone through the cameras, like a delivery guy or unexpected guest, creates a lot of awkward conversations through the system. Ideally... it works, and will help, but personalization and lack of settings to help your needs of the system can find a lot of improvement and hope these system flaws are improved as they are completely within the ability to improve function of their designs. Had these issues not been present the system would get 5 stars as the cameras are great, the system is very easy to install and get going, adds piece of mind that you otherwise wouldn’t have with out a high dollar monthly contract. All in all, it’s an improvement to safety, but many things can improve to make it effective and useful. Until then, it’s just bland'}\n",

I started our Blink system with several second generation XT cameras. The batteries did not last more than a few months inside a heated garage probably because of the high frequency of usage but that is not the worst complaint. The worst complaint is that they do always need my cell phone to have very strong, excellent 4-5 bar service in order to receive alerts. Please understand that I would always get alerts if my phone was in range of a strong WiFi signal but the point of the system is to get alerts anywhere one has cell service. This simply didn't happen when cell service is less than stellar. So I absolutely cannot recommend the Blink system if you want a serious security system. Please invest in a better system that may be wired or wireless but with a 100% notification rate.

These cameras are VERY easy to setup. You load the app on your phone, open the back of the camera and scan a barcode. You can do all five on your kitchen table, label them in the app and then mount them on your house. I had one on the table that didn\\'t seem to work so well. Reading information online indicated that I needed to remove the batteries for 30 seconds and put them back in, and then it worked fine. Until a day later after it was mounted. Thumbnail failed. I brought it back to the bench, power cycled, and again and it immediately failed. I contacted support, explained this in an email, and right away, the support tech says it\\'s out of range of the wifi (It was next to the wifi and the sync module, but I couldn\\'t seem to get that across, the camera was locked up). So I mounted it NEXT to the wife and sync module, and again the tech was baffled it had full signal, but something was blocking it (NOPE, nothing there pal, and my other cameras are MUCH further away) Today I got an email asking how my support was. This indicates my case was closed, no one sends a \"how we doing?\" email in the middle of support. Anyway, if you made it this far, here\\'s the rest. The night vision on these is pretty poor, my RING doorbell is much better and older. The trigger range is roughly 25 feet. On my working cameras, I had the meter reader looking in my office window and the camera never triggered despite him walking INTO my yard, within 3 feet of the camera, moving to the neighbor\\'s house and back across the yard. That was on standard settings. They also lag, unlike a RING device, they will not show you what triggered the camera. Birds and insects are often the culprit on mine. If you want an easy camera setup, I do suggest these. If you have areas to cover like your front door, or back door that someone will loiter in, these work fine. But so far, tech support lacks. EDIT: After my initial review, I was contacted by an Amazon Executive Representative who made sure I was taken care of, he did NOT solicit this review. He had already shipped me a new camera and an RMA for the old one. My other four cameras remain mounted and operational. The new camera works exactly like the others and now I have the peace of mind knowing that my home is completely covered with fully working cameras. This took a whole ten minutes to fix. I suggest you set these up next to your wifi and sync module and test recording options and snapshots before mounting them. Contact support right away if any issues occur.'}\n",

The mount needs work, as I've touched on in my original review, but now you're just going backwards, leaving this second part of the mount out of the package! Also, I was sent a second camera because of my original review, and I noticed there seems to be a heavier coat of lens coatings, so perhaps this will alleviate some of the issues with the infrared bleed off?? Original review: The picture quality in daylight seems to be a lot better strangely, considering the specs are identical? The motion detection is still a crap shoot, picking up every small critter that roams through my yard, but missing trucks with trailers pulling into my driveway! I like the new way to open the back, except the stupid tool is going to get lost! The old way was pathetic! I wish they would change the way it snaps on to the swivel mount, because that's a crapshoot at best, and a piece of useless broken plastic waiting to happen! How about some sort of screw on?? But what is a big problem is the infrared light bleed off! Now this could be just as true for the XT and the XT2 as well, but that hasn't been an issue until now. I mounted this unit underneath my mailbox, but to keep traffic splash off of it, I constructed a little wooden enclosure to keep that from happening. Additionally it keeps people from walking by from seeing the camera there and messing with it, unless they are on my property and then it will pick up their presence and notify me. This enclosure covers left right rear and top (which is the bottom of the mailbox that I have it mounted to), with the bottom open for drainage and the front open for the camera, which is basically flush with the opening. Sure it's supposed to be waterproof, but do I really want every car going by splashing mud or soon to be frozen slush all over the camera for me to have to go out and clean off everyday? The answer is a resounding NO, which is why I built the enclosure, but unfortunately it somehow reflects the infrared light and puts halos around any distant lights. Owing to the fact that this is a distant overall view of my entire property, turning the infrared off is not an option, as it just gives me a black screen at night, with specular highlights of light bulbs. This was never explained or even broached as a subject by their crappy manual or online q&a! I had to figure it out myself by trial and error! But strangely this doesn't happen to the camera I've got crammed up into the ceiling corner of my garage? It's got walls close to it all around except for the front & bottom basically. What's the difference? Does it have to do with the angle? 45° versus 90° approximately?? How about some warnings and words of wisdom there Blink? Or some solutions? In the meantime I'm experimenting around with lining my enclosure with copper foil which is supposed to absorb infrared light, so maybe that will work? I'll find out whenever Amazon delivers my roll of foil at an additional expense, or maybe I'm just wasting more time and money! Maybe I should just send it back? Maybe this could have all been avoided if Blink would just offer the equivalent of a camera lens shield to slide over the camera body that doesn't reflect infrared... maybe??\"}\n",

The 2 way speaker works well. Battery life is ok. We purchased the cables and have the system on electricity. Connection with Alexa also works well. It took a while to find a place to hang the sync module where it would cover all the cameras in the system. Definitely picks up motion... TOO GOOD! A moving shadow of nearby trees, change in light from the sun moving from behind a cloud, shadows on the ground and more will set it off! Needs work!! We turn off zones during the day because of this, making those cameras useless. Depending on time of year, shadows move and change, meaning continued adjustment of camera zones. It would help if the exact area of motion detection was highlighted in the video, so you could eliminate that video section in the program. I do not recommend it anywhere there are trees, shrubbery or plants that move with breezes or the wind. You can deselect areas that each camera picks up to eliminate sections of the video in the program (there is a grid for each camera view and you can “gray out” sections of what the camera “sees”). This will prevent the alarm from tripping. Keep in mind that the camera is viewing in 2D, so if you are deselecting a section for a shadow on a sidewalk, it will not pick up someone walking through the deselected area. The system has the right idea, but needs work to prevent constant alarming for zones exposed to changes in light and planting movement.'}\n",

Do you need a motion activated, WIRELESS camera you can put anywhere within wifi range? This is the best (I've tried or tested them all!). For example, Arlo wireless cameras might as well not be wireless because the batteries run down so fast (even with minimum usage) that you have to place the cameras where they are easily accessible all of the time. That really defeats the purpose of being wireless. With Blink, we are able to place cameras wherever we want, without drilling holes, running wire, etc, and then leave whenever we want for as long as we want, knowing that the cameras will just work. If you use the lithium batteries they require, and use reasonable settings, you will get the advertised battery life, or more! Go mobile! We can even put a cell phone (with hotspot on) in a little weatherproof bag along with a little dual port battery bank and the Blink module and setup a temporary system anywhere outdoors (within range of the hotspot) and monitor up to five cameras on game trails, property, vehicles, etc, and get alerts wherever you are (within cell coverage).

Another MAJOR flaw is that you cannot access a live view from the camera if it is actively recording. I get an alert that motion was detected.

Cameras at one location monitor a 94 year old senior who lives alone. The others are used as security cameras at a residence and a vacation home. Having instant alerts tied to immediate access to recorded video makes these work from a security perspective. However, it looks like Amazon is trying to execute a flawed (subscription-based) business model tied to the new Upgraded Blink Cameras. The cameras are the same from a technical security standpoint but use of the system appears to have been substantially modified so Amazon can  benefit from reoccurring revenue from expensive subscriptions. I hope they fine tune this roll out so that all users will have immediate access to videos and have the ability to store the videos to document the event for law enforcement. In our case, we need that ability and also need to quickly respond to the needs of our 94 year old family member who lives alone. Waiting until the end of the day to see video clips could result in a life and death situation. Charging a $10 fee per month ($120 per year) for a subscription per location and/or location is very expensive. In our case this would cause us to look for another product. The Blink cameras are good but they aren't the best quality cameras on the market. Making their use expensive will cause a lot of loyal Blink users to look elsewhere. I sure hope they rethink this because it appears they might be too aggressive in their attempt to make the Blink camera business model more profitable. For now, we will continue to use our 24 Blink cameras for security and elder care and see how Amazon fine tunes this hopefully to make it a win win for them and loyal Blink camera users. Update: Blink was kind enough to send me one of the new cameras to install and review. They also informed me that because I have been a loyal Blink camera user from before April 2020 that I will never be charged a fee for storage of camera videos. That is good that they grandfather folks into the program. Also, I have to say that the new improved camera is much better. It is sealed much better from the weather and it appears to fit on all of the original mounts, etc. so these new cameras will easily replace the older ones when they wear out which seems to take for ever because of my cameras have been in operation for more than two years.

So far the only problem I have encountered is it takes the camera to start photos' I had some with nothing in it apparently who ever set it off had move out of the frame when the video started I have been tweaking the adjustments and moved it for a stronger signal. Apparently yesterday I was working outside with the system armed and got loads of pictures and a notice that there was too much activity which would affect battery usage and to arm when needed, which is when I expect a package and at night.  I would hope Ring would update firmware to have time setup like my Kasa cam which allows me to arm and disarm at a time I could set.

An example of this is, I received a package from ups and he parked his truck, walked up and set the package on my porch next to the door and walked back to his truck and drove off. My driveway is 40 feet long and the camera can see all of it. I received a motion alert but the camera recorded nothing, just a 10 second clip of an empty driveway.

With their new two factor authentication requirement, it is now impossible for anyone else in my household to access the cameras in their own home because to login in, they have to receive a code from my phone number. Blink, and Amazon their parent company, don’t care about you or how you use their products.  They aren’t interested in any feedback. I tried contacting them about this policy and explaining why it wouldn’t work.  The response I received back from them was a long paraphrase describing two factor authentication and how this is a good thing for my account. This response was clearly copied and pasted from a script, and proof the company doesn’t even want to attempt to address the issue. The company (Amazon) doesn’t want to hear from their customers how they use the products.  Instead they want to tell us how we should use their products. They will not make two-factor authentication optional. If you’re going to be the only person who needs access to the cameras, then they are pretty good cameras.

Thought Blink would be better - or at least comparable. Not close.  It is nice to have battery-operated cameras that can be in the elements. Easy to set up. But - the static noise/feedback is probably the most ridiculous thing ever. It's like it is so sensitive that it is just making up sound that blasts in your ears. You cannot hear anything else going on - even a conversation right near the camera...only this horrible sound. Also, when you look back at the recorded clips, the feedback sound is gone, but the audio on the voices is now very very low. And if you listen very carefully you can hear the feedback sound isn't truly gone; it's just muted. So disappointing and too late to return, as we were working with Blink customer service (reset cameras, reset wifi, etc - total waste of time).

With this, we are going to replace that device for you. But just to give you a heads-up that liquid damage is not normally covered under warranty and this is for 1-time courtesy, In order to process your replacement, we will need the following information: - Physical Shipping Address (Cannot be a P.O Box) - Phone Number Once we receive your reply with the information above, we can initiate your replacement as soon as possible. Thank you, Regards, Jess Blink Technical Support Then I was asked to supply more photos of the fogged lens. But as any educated adult could imagine after sitting in my house with the batteries out and the cover off the lens was very clear again. So I guess bottom line is you may have holes in your security for a few days at a time to let your cameras dry out if you have same problem. Since these are not covered if they leak.

We originally bought these as security cameras and they work good for that but we quickly realized how good they are for wildlife. Now I have one aimed at a bird feeder, one inside our owl house and one inside a squirrel house in addition to security uses. We have a mated pair of owls and can watch them any time we want from anywhere. It also does a great job of recording wildlife sounds. We have very cold & snowy weather here but the batteries hold up surprisingly well. They are easy to set up and run well. My oldest one is about a year old and the batteries are still good despite a LOT of use. We’ve had no problems with the wifii or anything else. In the daytime they do a reasonably good job with color images and at night the infrared is pretty cool for wildlife. Not quite so good for security at a distance. The motion detection is ok. It took me over 6 months before I realized that I could set “where” the motion gets detected by going into settings and changing it. ( I tend not to read directions LOL ) The default motion detection field is on the sides and often times you’d rather have it right in front of the camera. Changing it to where you want is important. I’m using the beta of the quick motion all the time and it works ok. It’s fine for security but not so great at catching fast flying owls. I have the previous version of Blink XT outdoor so I got the free cloud storage. I am not sure what other differences there are. The newer ones have usb storage I think.'}\n",

It triggers at the smallest objects close by on the deck (see bird in picture), but won't record someone walking through the backyard. The delay is often also pretty long before recording starts, and despite it having a strong wifi signal. I'm also confused on the subscription service vs. local storage.

Couldn’t say no to that discount. Easy setup (Blink app/QR codes) and fast/reliable connection to my router. What sold me was the battery life. I’m sure my front door camera won’t last 2 years but I’m hoping for at least a year. I keep it at “standard” video quality to hopefully maintain good battery life. I adjusted the “activity zones” so my camera didn’t trigger too much when people would jog/walk/ride their bikes on the sidewalk or cars moving. I have it set to record 15sec clips with a 10sec retrigger time and set it at “5” for sensitivity. Catches my uncle when he checks my house, lol. I have a backyard camera that rarely gets triggered so I’m hoping for close to 2yr battery life on that camera. Night vision is not the greatest. Especially if you don’t have much light. Adjusting the IR intensity doesn’t help much. My Arlo Pro/Pro 2 cameras here in my main house have better night vision. If you have a motion security light, that will probably be the best solution so you can record in full color HD at night. The day video is great and the 2-way audio is pretty seamless. I would say the Blink microphone is better then my more expensive Arlo cameras. I sometimes get some weird feedback noise from the microphone during live view/recordings which I have no idea why that happens. Overall, really good system for the price and it runs on only 2 AA Lithium batteries. I won’t be happy when I’ll be forced to pay a subscription for cloud storage beginning Jan. 2021. Hopefully Blink/Amazon will reconsider. The new sync module 2 has local storage for backup so I installed a micro 2.0 USB 64gb drive which is more then enough for the short recordings. Would be nice if Blink did an update where we could access the local storage via app instead of the cloud. I watched a lot of reviews on YouTube/read reviews online. Based on other affordable options, this was the best wireless camera system for my 2nd house. I’d probably buy more cameras if they went on sale again.

CONs:  Works only on 2.4 WiFi so if you have a dual channel auto switching router then you have to set up two separate WiFi networks.  Pain but I did it.  Big CON for me was the audio.  All cameras produced a high pitched, screeching distortion sound during recordings that interfered with listening to someone near the camera.  Worked with off shore Blink customer service for three weeks and got nothing but \"try this\" solutions.  Finally gave up.  Although the speaker has an adjustable volume control in Settings, the microphone has only an on/off setting.  I believe the microphone is overly senstive and causing the feedback.  I would not recommend this system if you want to be able to speak with individuals at an entry point.  Would be fine if you just want to get alerts and see video.

I haven’t even had it more  a month and it’s saying the battery is needing to be replaced when it’s been on the default settings and it lags and doesn’t even load the live view fast enough to know what it was and doesn’t add the clip for minutes to let you see and fog or smoke or bugs set it off when it should be small enough to know it’s not a person flying in the air by it. It constantly detects the slightest tree moving in the wind which messes the battery up even more I’m sure. The talk feature on mine never has worked and I tried multiple times and I’m sending mine back so I’m not going to bother a third attempt for it. Any product that says 2 year battery we have doubts about and we were correct to doubt it and even with the lowest settings I doubt it would last that much and it doesn’t even get that clear of a view at night. Not worth 99$ or even 40$ don’t buy it unless you want to regret it. Anyone giving it a high rating must be paid to do it or works for Amazon because by all the other bad reviews it seem pretty unlikely anyone says good things and is probably why it dropped almost half the price for Black Friday and sold the two pack for the price of this one, because they must see all the bad reviews and want to sell them all fast to get rid of them all. Horrible product and this is the first bad review I’ve ever left which shows how annoyed I am by it.'}\n",

Example two driveway cameras aimed at my driveway from two different directions. The old one picks up a raccoon walking across the driveway and the other new one does not. Both are set the same. And the one that does picks up the raccoon as he leaving and not when entering the field of motion detection. The house side new camera only picks up the raccoon as he is leaving the field of motion.

Once I downloaded the app the set up was not overly complicated. When installing these they provide the hardware to mount them unless you plan on going in to something harder than wood. I would still suggest drilling a pilot hole for the screw before mounting them.  Snapping the two plastic pieces together is pretty rough so I would suggest doing that prior to mounting the camera to the physical mount. The other thing to keep in mind is that if someone does come along and smacks it pretty hard the camera is going to fall off. I do think they need to improve on securing the mount to the camera better. They make it easy for the consumer to change the batteries but it also makes it easy for someone to just knock it down staying out of the line of sight of the camera unless mounted out of reach. The picture quality both day and night are pretty good as well as the coverage area, I was pleasantly surprised on how much coverage I get of an area with such a small camera.  I found the higher the better when mounting these not to mention the safety of someone being able to reach one and knock it off.  Viewing the clips in the apps once armed is very straight forward as well as maintaining the clips.  I did see some lag when going to a live video feed and they only stay on so long before once going live. The last item would be how it integrates with the Alexa App, I was disappointed to find out that you can not add these to a routine in arming and disarming. You can arm and disarm them by stating Alexa tell Blink to do_________ and she recognizes the command.  So yes it works with Alexa but IMO since Blink is an Amazon company it could be a cleaner solution. Overall I am satisfied and would more than likely purchase another set to be placed in other locations around my house.'}\n",

A friend showed me his xt2 and I couldn’t believe the clarity so I bought these immediately. I was a litttle reluctant once I started reading all the negative reviews, but am now convinced many of those reviews were by people who didn’t know how to correctly set their cameras up. Believe it or not there is a strategy to it. Watch YouTube for tips and advice. That’s 90 percent of it. These are Way better than my zosi system I’ve been using. FYI-this isn’t a system you’ll set up and be done with in 20 min. You have to give it a few days and make minor adjustments to the settings (very simple) until you get them they way you want them. I started with my sensitivity all the way up and slowly worked my way down over a few days until I got em just right. The bad -the mounts they come with are cheap and not very secure...they snap into the back of the camera. Just a bird landing on it will probably knock it off.  I plan to buy their mount kit for my cameras as they’re only 20 bucks. The good -crystal clear image during the day, night vision is pretty good, but it’s better if you have security lighting. These pictures are on “good” setting, “best” is even clearer, but not necessary in my opinion -a lot of different settings so the cameras suit anybody’s needs, and they did it without making it complicated.  Ir intensity (night vision), image quality, two way audio, clip length, sensitivity, etc. you can even select dead spots if there’s a tree or light that trigger the sensor. -you can add more cameras in the future and I plan to do just that. -setup was quick and easy. Took me about 20 min to install and connect five cameras. -wide view. My other systems claimed 110 degree view but came nowhere near the blink system. It’s not just wide, it’s deep. I can see so much further (and clearer) than my other camera systems. -signal strength. I have one of the cameras out on the end of my barn (about 65 feet from the sinc module) I couldn’t believe it worked so far away. -the app notifies me of motion alerts when the system is armed and I can click right on it and watch. -the module has a usb connection so you can store everything on a usb or external hard drive instead of paying the new monthly fee for cloud storage. Think that’s everything. I’ll update the review if I have any problems but so far I’m very satisfied, and very very impressed.'}\n",

They do appear to work just like the existing XT2 cameras I have, saving clips to the cloud when they are armed and motion is detected.  The Blink Mini also seems to not have the delay in recording that the XT2s have where sometimes you've missed whatever triggered the motion detection. So if you were an existing Blink XT or XT2 user, feel free to get these to add to your system, they work and they work well. However, for new users to the Blink ecosystem they would still have to pay for cloud storage unless they set up and use the Blink local storage option, which is not hard but not as convenient and costs extra.  With AWS storage so cheap it would still be nice if some level of basic cloud storage was provided, with option to do paid upgrade to more if needed. You'll need to get a mini-SD card for the local storage option, but it appears to work just like the cloud storage works which is great.  Perhaps in the future this could be bundled with the camera packages. Overall, very happy with the system and I can recommend for an indoor / outdoor camera system. Original Review: I have 5 cameras but still have a few areas I wanted to cover outside as well as pick up a Blink Mini or two for inside.  Went to pick up a few more of these on Prime Day but now see there's no free cloud storage anymore, and its a monthly fee of $10 (120 a year).  Gonna have to skip adding new cameras that need a cloud storage fee, as well as skip a purchase for my elderly father-in-law that I was gonna surprise with a 5 camera system.  Neither of us want something with recurring fees.  This makes me sad :(\"}\n",

Pros 1) super easy to install.. brackets snap right on..but also a con..see that con list 2)sync module has storage so you dont have to pay for the dumb cloud subscription ..huge plus 3) its made well 4) picture is high quality 5)has usb port for direct power case batteries are not your thing...also small con see below 6)i do LOVE how night vision DOESN\\'T kick on when my light on at night (my security light though is super bright, but my ring doorbell still shows night vision) 7) cheaper thn ring Cons 1) brackets bc they just snap on makes it very easy to steal! 2)no continuous live view.. went to mount..im on a high ladder with my phone in my hand and camera in the other trying to get right angel and it cuts off! Pain in the blank. (Several more cons below that goes with this con) anyways most people like continuous use so you see whats going on 3) app sucks!.. its takes like 10 secs for pic to load AND has 5 sec delay on the live feed. So statement above, do you have any idea how long it took to get angel right when mounting?! Try imaging that again while swapping the batteries! (Another con) so if you have burglar and your alert goes off at front door, to late hes done did gone upstairs in your bedroom time you receive it. 4) while its in recording mode you cannot speak to to the person unless its in live view.. this beats the purpose! Now what am i supposed to do?! \"Disarm\" the system take a geuss who\\'s at the front door click \"live view\" just so i can speak. Soo if its \"armed\" bc of the delay I said above, you wait for the recording to stop bc it doesn\\'t have continuous live view and you click live view to speak and wait for another darn delay...you didn\\'t bark off that burglar, he already broke in. Or even if you wanna thank Amazon delivery person time you get to speak he or she already drove off. ...now I am gonna try moving module closer, but as of now its 25ft away outta 100ft range. (Maybe its my metal building setting frequency off.. shoulder shrug) 5) you cannot speak threw your echo, only view and listen. Only app let\\'s you talk. Again pretty stupid considering Amazon makes this product! 6) charging port on the back but doesn\\'t recharge the batteries. You have dismount everything just to change batteries. Cheap batteries do not last 2 years..sorry... these cameras use more power than a tv remote. Again what I said about mounting them..i have a metal shop just use ext. cord and tucked it away, cant really do that on a house..aspecialy in higher spot. 7)I cant figure out how to disarm only one camera without disarming both. Pretty sure there\\'s a way but I like tp keep it simple with a button or voice command So basically to conclude this humorous but serious review I got these 2 cameras so I can watch outside my shop when im working or get alerted if a customer comes to the door, id know..when im away turn on the other camera so keep an eye on my shop. I cant really do that so thats why 2 star rating...... Now it still serves the general purpose case something does happen at least I\\'ll have footage. So if that\\'s what your looking for get this. All this being said 90% of the cons are stupid app things and can be fixed by simple software updates and what not. I see alot people complaining about same issues and it\\'s been awhile and they still haven\\'t fixed them. As you can see alot small issues lead to big issues.

I use them for surveillance outside my home (driveway, front and back entrances, front sidewalk, and inside the garage). Two of them started giving me a 'camera offline' message and no images. On one camera, I changed the lithium batteries twice, but got the same message 24 hours later each time. Another camera is starting to do the same thing. I've done everything Blink support suggested. Also, there is a delay from when something sets off my cameras and when I receive an alert on my cell phone.  I have a 75 foot driveway, and sometimes a visitor is almost at my door by the time I can view what's in the driveway.  It's all in the playback, but I wouldn't say these cameras provide very much warning of approaching visitors.  If I decide to add replacement cameras, it won't be these.\"}\n",

Video quality is good but experienced several “Live View Failed” in my short time testing it. Live view does not seem very robust.  The app is mediocre at best. This is where the biggest issue lies – you can only use the app.  No web-based usage (unlike Ring) and the Alexa Show is only one-way (unlike Ring) making it useless. So, you are stuck with the poor app. Unfortunate that Amazon is not putting any effort behind this system.  If you must own a Ring or Blink, just go for Ring.

Quality is fine, I didn't expect much since battery life dictates leaving them on standard quality to avoid living on a straight ladder on the side of my house. My major complaint is after less than a year, one of them has become almost as useful as a paperweight. It's the main camera at my front door, so it certainly got the heaviest use. I will be the first to admit that I had the sensitivity too high for that location and it was triggered constantly by passing vehicles. However, I have had them less than a year and that camera now constantly says low battery, even after putting fresh ones in. It will not let me live view, but it does still record motion activated clips. I realize I didn't spend a fortune on these, but I feel like the basic functionality they offer at their price point should work as intended. I am outside the customer service window, so I will be forced to purchase a new one to replace it. I am hesitant based on this experience, but the other two I have still work fine so I am hoping this is just a fluke. If you're looking for a low cost wireless security solution, I would still recommend these, but if you have the money to purchase a wired system with a dedicated hard drive and the time to install it, that may be a better solution.\"}\n",

The intent was to keep an eye on things while I am in one location or the other. They have always been somewhat random in the motion detection, and the image quality has always been sketchy at best. They are best used inside the house to keep an eye on your pets throughout the day, and not as a serious security camera system. Recently I decided to upgrade the cameras at my place at the beach to the \"new\" outdoor cameras that Blink sells. One of them lasted about a month before I started to get hazy or fuzzy looking images. I figured that maybe a bird had left a gift on the camera and eventually I would have to get on a ladder and clean it. When I was able to get up on a ladder, I realized that the issue was water behind the lens. I originally contacted Amazon about returning this one camera and getting a replacement, but was told they could only refund my money. Since I purchased this on PRIME day, if I returned all three of the camera I got with that set, it would cost me more to just get 2 back, so I decided not to go that route. I then contacted Blink customer service. Let me tell you....maybe the worst customer service experience I\\'ve ever had. They first asked me to change a setting on the cameras so they had access to them, which I did. Then they asked me to start sending video\\'s. I sent several to them, and they all looked the same, they would claim the lighting was bad, or it was located in a bad spot, or there was a glare, video after video there was an excuse. Keep in mind that the first thing they asked was for access to the cameras. Finally I got up on a ladder and sent them the photos that are attached here. They came back with the camera has been \"under water\" or has been \"physically damaged\" These cameras are hanging high on a wall, at the beach, where NO trees even exist. The only way they would be \"under water\" is for a cat 5 hurricane to hit the area, and I don\\'t think the cameras would be my biggest concern. The only way \"physical damage\" could happen is for possibly a bird to kamikaze into the camera, but I believe I would be able to tell that to. Bottom line, these cameras are obviously built cheaper than the previous models, those weren\\'t great to start with, now that I know they also don\\'t back their product, I would not recommend anyone purchasing these, unless like I said previously, you wanted to sit a few of them around the inside of your house, and keep an eye on your pets, otherwise, they\\'re just a gimmick that you likely will be disappointed in.'}\n",

I\\'ll have a delivery and it wouldn\\'t catch the delivery person until after they\\'ve walked onto my walkway and up the stairs and release the package and walk back and thats when it\\'ll catch the person. Doesn\\'t make for good security if it doesn\\'t catch the person in time now does it. The speakers/intercom isn\\'t bad. If anything I think these work much better indoors versus outdoors.'}\n",

No problem what so ever not with internet signal or anything and that’s even after we have had hard freeze and a lot of snow with temps below 0 degrees. I’m so glad I decided to get these. The motion sensor works well you just have to check it out while mounting to gauge just how far away it will pick up and if you have bad areas where traffic or animals trigger just black those areas out on the photo and no bothers for motion in those spots again. I’m bout to buy a few add on cameras. I only purchased a 2 pack initially but that’s due to target having same sale price as all the other stores however they had offer to purchase an Amazon show 5 for just 10.00 and also threw in a free smart outlet as a bundle. Customer support is amazing as well I had questions cause I got the hard cover for the mounts and didn’t realize they covered up the ir sensor cause they were designed for previous camera model. They responded very quickly and helped me out so I ended up just using my dremel to cut out more of the facing on the covers and not a prob. Painted the white hard covers using craft acrylic paint to match my vinyl siding. Company I purchased covers/mounts from on Amazon then offered me a 30.00 Amazon e gift card just for adding a review and taking screen shot and emailing it to them. Amazing all around. Can’t go wrong with these in my opinion. I’ve had issues n past with even a roku express not picking up signal for wifi in my sons room much less outside. So that should tell u something regarding the amazing wifi signal this picks up due to the sync module. I chose not to have a monthly fee and just plugged a flash drive into my sync module.

If we armed the camera all the time I could understand why the batteries don't last but we don't.  They probably do not average 10 motion detections before they are disarmed and some nights I don't even arm the system.

I still recommend saving up for something better if you need actual reliability. ::Original Review:: I only bought this because QVC had it for 5 easy payments and our dogs kept barking at the oddest things at night and I was tired of getting out of bed to check it out. Well, if anything ever did actually happen these cameras would be pointless. The delay to view what's happening is so long anyone outside could be gone by the time they kick in. It's no better then just getting up myself. The quality isn't the great either, which I didn't totally mind at first as a novice to security cameras. But, now it's obnoxious. When you try to speak to someone there is also a delay in the speaking too. If I say Hello it takes the camera a few moments to switch so I can hear what they're saying. But, by the time it does it, they've already started talking and I only catch the end of their sentence. Outside of that there was petty issues like placing it where it wouldn't be constantly going off or figuring out where to put it so it would pick up things.

Where to start. Well I bought these thinking the app would have more functionality, like being able to see all live feeds at the same time in real time. And that the product would do more. Theres no live feed video monitoring in the classic sense, meaning open the app, and have all cameras instantaneously running a live feed.  Now I understand why, because if they did, the batteries would be dead in a week. But I don't mind running a power cable to my camera. 2nd the app is slow, and honestly my 3rd is my biggest tout with the blinks. The motion detection  can not tell the difference between my dog, a shadow, and a person. So I get hundreds of motion elerts throughout the day. And scanning through those, takes hours. I so not recommend this product, for several reasons. The 2yr battery life is not real, it may last you 3-6months in real life scenarios. The night vision is okay. Picking up motion its late, and won't tell the difference. If you buy this product, I wish you luck, and hope you have a better experience.

It\\'s disappointing when you buy something and you expect a certain service and it gets changed a few months down the road. And I can\\'t even buy the old cameras I have in order to avoid the storage fees. Again, the main reason I initially purchased this system was because of the \"no monthly storage fee\". I wouldn\\'t even have a problem if they incorporated something in with the amazon prime membership, I\\'m sure what we pay for the subscription can cover the cost of the storage. I\\'m not even opposed to limiting the storage space for recordings to a certain amount of time or data space. Again  I like the system and the quality of the cameras however the change in the storage fee makes me just want to sell these for what I can and buy something else.'}\n",

Even after adjusting all the settings to lowest quality these still drained the battery in days and had the same shutter issue. it seemed to happen more recently not sure why. If you have multiple camera's on a big property it doesn't matter if you invest heavily in your wifi because you must have a sync module close by.  Often i will have 110mbs at the camera on wifi but only one bar on the sync module. t The indoor versions work perfectly and do not require the sync module and can connect to any close by wifi. the outdoor versions require a sync module and wifi to be close by.

Everyday I get a notification at this camera and there is no motion. The camera has a time lapse I guess. It shows the morning and speeds through to the night within a matter of 10secs. It’s very strange! It does capture motion to my liking, it notifies me even when the neighborhood cat goes past it. I haven’t experienced any connectivity issues HOWEVER the night vision is TERRIBLE! It always looks scruffy and blurry. It just started this, so I can’t return it (purchased from Best Buy during $59.99 sale). Bring back the XT2! Overall, I’d recommend.

I have to constantly change the battery every 2-3 weeks. (Which can be annoying) this is only because I have changed my settings for the video to last longer, which drains the battery and as well as upgrading the picture quality. Another con is the video clip length it starts from 5 secs to only 1 minute. A video length like that is useless if your purpose is to have a good security camera. You can record up to 5 mins of the video as long as you are live, but not when the camera detects something by itself. The blink app and storage is good for me, no complaints about that.
